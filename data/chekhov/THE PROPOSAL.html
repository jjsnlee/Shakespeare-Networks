<h2>THE PROPOSAL</h2>
<p>The scene is laid at CHUBUKOV's country-house</p>
<p>A drawing-room in CHUBUKOV'S house.</p>
<p>[LOMOV enters, wearing a dress-jacket and white gloves. CHUBUKOV rises<br>
        to meet him.]</p>
<a name=1.1.1><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> My dear fellow, whom do I see! Ivan Vassilevitch! I am<br>
        extremely glad! [Squeezes his hand] Now this is a surprise, my<br>
        darling... How are you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.2><b>LOMOV.</b> Thank you. And how may you be getting on?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.3><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> We just get along somehow, my angel, to your prayers, and so<br>
        on. Sit down, please do.... Now, you know, you shouldn't forget all<br>
        about your neighbours, my darling. My dear fellow, why are you so formal<br>
        in your get-up? Evening dress, gloves, and so on. Can you be going<br>
        anywhere, my treasure?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.4><b>LOMOV.</b> No, I've come only to see you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.5><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Then why are you in evening dress, my precious? As if you're<br>
        paying a New Year's Eve visit!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.6><b>LOMOV.</b> Well, you see, it's like this. [Takes his arm] I've come to you,<br>
        honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, to trouble you with a request. Not once or<br>
        twice have I already had the privilege of applying to you for help, and<br>
        you have always, so to speak... I must ask your pardon, I am getting<br>
        excited. I shall drink some water, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.<br>
        [Drinks.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.7><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> [Aside] He's come to borrow money! Shan't give him any!<br>
        [Aloud] What is it, my beauty?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.8><b>LOMOV.</b> You see, Honour Stepanitch... I beg pardon, Stepan Honouritch...<br>
        I mean, I'm awfully excited, as you will please notice.... In short, you<br>
        alone can help me, though I don't deserve it, of course... and haven't<br>
        any right to count on your assistance....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.9><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Oh, don't go round and round it, darling! Spit it out! Well?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.10><b>LOMOV.</b> One moment... this very minute. The fact is, I've come to ask the<br>
        hand of your daughter, Natalya Stepanovna, in marriage.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.11><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> [Joyfully] By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again&mdash;I<br>
        didn't hear it all!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.12><b>LOMOV.</b> I have the honour to ask...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.13><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> [Interrupting] My dear fellow... I'm so glad, and so on....<br>
        Yes, indeed, and all that sort of thing. [Embraces and kisses LOMOV]<br>
        I've been hoping for it for a long time. It's been my continual desire.<br>
        [Sheds a tear] And I've always loved you, my angel, as if you were my<br>
        own son. May God give you both His help and His love and so on, and I<br>
        did so much hope... What am I behaving in this idiotic way for? I'm off<br>
        my balance with joy, absolutely off my balance! Oh, with all my soul...<br>
        I'll go and call Natasha, and all that.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.14><b>LOMOV.</b> [Greatly moved] Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may<br>
        count on her consent?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.15><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Why, of course, my darling, and... as if she won't consent!<br>
        She's in love; egad, she's like a love-sick cat, and so on.... Shan't be<br>
        long! [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.16><b>LOMOV.</b> It's cold... I'm trembling all over, just as if I'd got an<br>
        examination before me. The great thing is, I must have my mind made up.<br>
        If I give myself time to think, to hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for<br>
        an ideal, or for real love, then I'll never get married.... Brr!... It's<br>
        cold! Natalya Stepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking,<br>
        well-educated.... What more do I want? But I'm getting a noise in my<br>
        ears from excitement. [Drinks] And it's impossible for me not to<br>
        marry.... In the first place, I'm already 35&mdash;a critical age, so to<br>
        speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life....<br>
        I suffer from palpitations, I'm excitable and always getting awfully<br>
        upset.... At this very moment my lips are trembling, and there's a<br>
        twitch in my right eyebrow.... But the very worst of all is the way I<br>
        sleep. I no sooner get into bed and begin to go off when suddenly<br>
        something in my left side&mdash;gives a pull, and I can feel it in my<br>
        shoulder and head.... I jump up like a lunatic, walk about a bit, and<br>
        lie down again, but as soon as I begin to get off to sleep there's<br>
        another pull! And this may happen twenty times....</a><br>
<p>[NATALYA STEPANOVNA comes in.]</p>
<a name=1.1.17><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Well, there! It's you, and papa said, "Go; there's a<br>
        merchant come for his goods." How do you do, Ivan Vassilevitch!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.18><b>LOMOV.</b> How do you do, honoured Natalya Stepanovna?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.19><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> You must excuse my apron and nÈgligÈ... we're<br>
        shelling peas for drying. Why haven't you been here for such a long<br>
        time? Sit down. [They seat themselves] Won't you have some lunch?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.20><b>LOMOV.</b> No, thank you, I've had some already.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.21><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Then smoke.... Here are the matches.... The weather<br>
        is splendid now, but yesterday it was so wet that the workmen didn't do<br>
        anything all day. How much hay have you stacked? Just think, I felt<br>
        greedy and had a whole field cut, and now I'm not at all pleased about<br>
        it because I'm afraid my hay may rot. I ought to have waited a bit. But<br>
        what's this? Why, you're in evening dress! Well, I never! Are you going<br>
        to a ball, or what?&mdash;though I must say you look better. Tell me,<br>
        why are you got up like that?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.22><b>LOMOV.</b> [Excited] You see, honoured Natalya Stepanovna... the fact is,<br>
        I've made up my mind to ask you to hear me out.... Of course you'll be<br>
        surprised and perhaps even angry, but a... [Aside] It's awfully cold!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.23><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> What's the matter? [Pause] Well?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.24><b>LOMOV.</b> I shall try to be brief. You must know, honoured Natalya<br>
        Stepanovna, that I have long, since my childhood, in fact, had the<br>
        privilege of knowing your family. My late aunt and her husband, from<br>
        whom, as you know, I inherited my land, always had the greatest respect<br>
        for your father and your late mother. The Lomovs and the Chubukovs have<br>
        always had the most friendly, and I might almost say the most<br>
        affectionate, regard for each other. And, as you know, my land is a near<br>
        neighbour of yours. You will remember that my Oxen Meadows touch your<br>
        birchwoods.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.25><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Excuse my interrupting you. You say, "my Oxen<br>
        Meadows...." But are they yours?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.26><b>LOMOV.</b> Yes, mine.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.27><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> What are you talking about? Oxen Meadows are ours,<br>
        not yours!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.28><b>LOMOV.</b> No, mine, honoured Natalya Stepanovna.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.29><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Well, I never knew that before. How do you make that<br>
        out?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.30><b>LOMOV.</b> How? I'm speaking of those Oxen Meadows which are wedged in<br>
        between your birchwoods and the Burnt Marsh.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.31><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Yes, yes.... They're ours.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.32><b>LOMOV.</b> No, you're mistaken, honoured Natalya Stepanovna, they're mine.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.33><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Just think, Ivan Vassilevitch! How long have they<br>
        been yours?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.34><b>LOMOV.</b> How long? As long as I can remember.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.35><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Really, you won't get me to believe that!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.36><b>LOMOV.</b> But you can see from the documents, honoured Natalya Stepanovna.<br>
        Oxen Meadows, it's true, were once the subject of dispute, but now<br>
        everybody knows that they are mine. There's nothing to argue about. You<br>
        see, my aunt's grandmother gave the free use of these Meadows in<br>
        perpetuity to the peasants of your father's grandfather, in return for<br>
        which they were to make bricks for her. The peasants belonging to your<br>
        father's grandfather had the free use of the Meadows for forty years,<br>
        and had got into the habit of regarding them as their own, when it<br>
        happened that...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.37><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> No, it isn't at all like that! Both my grandfather<br>
        and great-grandfather reckoned that their land extended to Burnt Marsh&mdash;which<br>
        means that Oxen Meadows were ours. I don't see what there is to argue<br>
        about. It's simply silly!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.38><b>LOMOV.</b> I'll show you the documents, Natalya Stepanovna!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.39><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> No, you're simply joking, or making fun of me....<br>
        What a surprise! We've had the land for nearly three hundred years, and<br>
        then we're suddenly told that it isn't ours! Ivan Vassilevitch, I can<br>
        hardly believe my own ears.... These Meadows aren't worth much to me.<br>
        They only come to five dessiatins [Note: 13.5 acres], and are worth<br>
        perhaps 300 roubles [Note: £30.], but I can't stand unfairness. Say what<br>
        you will, but I can't stand unfairness.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.40><b>LOMOV.</b> Hear me out, I implore you! The peasants of your father's<br>
        grandfather, as I have already had the honour of explaining to you, used<br>
        to bake bricks for my aunt's grandmother. Now my aunt's grandmother,<br>
        wishing to make them a pleasant...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.41><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> I can't make head or tail of all this about aunts<br>
        and grandfathers and grandmothers! The Meadows are ours, and that's all.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.42><b>LOMOV.</b> Mine.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.43><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Ours! You can go on proving it for two days on end,<br>
        you can go and put on fifteen dress-jackets, but I tell you they're<br>
        ours, ours, ours! I don't want anything of yours and I don't want to<br>
        give up anything of mine. So there!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.44><b>LOMOV.</b> Natalya Ivanovna, I don't want the Meadows, but I am acting on<br>
        principle. If you like, I'll make you a present of them.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.45><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> I can make you a present of them myself, because<br>
        they're mine! Your behaviour, Ivan Vassilevitch, is strange, to say the<br>
        least! Up to this we have always thought of you as a good neighbour, a<br>
        friend: last year we lent you our threshing-machine, although on that<br>
        account we had to put off our own threshing till November, but you<br>
        behave to us as if we were gipsies. Giving me my own land, indeed! No,<br>
        really, that's not at all neighbourly! In my opinion, it's even<br>
        impudent, if you want to know....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.46><b>LOMOV.</b> Then you make out that I'm a land-grabber? Madam, never in my<br>
        life have I grabbed anybody else's land, and I shan't allow anybody to<br>
        accuse me of having done so.... [Quickly steps to the carafe and drinks<br>
        more water] Oxen Meadows are mine!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.47><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> It's not true, they're ours!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.48><b>LOMOV.</b> Mine!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.49><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> It's not true! I'll prove it! I'll send my mowers<br>
        out to the Meadows this very day!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.50><b>LOMOV.</b> What?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.51><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> My mowers will be there this very day!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.52><b>LOMOV.</b> I'll give it to them in the neck!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.53><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> You dare!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.54><b>LOMOV.</b> [Clutches at his heart] Oxen Meadows are mine! You understand?<br>
        Mine!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.55><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Please don't shout! You can shout yourself hoarse in<br>
        your own house, but here I must ask you to restrain yourself!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.56><b>LOMOV.</b> If it wasn't, madam, for this awful, excruciating palpitation, if<br>
        my whole inside wasn't upset, I'd talk to you in a different way!<br>
        [Yells] Oxen Meadows are mine!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.57><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Ours!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.58><b>LOMOV.</b> Mine!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.59><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Ours!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.60><b>LOMOV.</b> Mine!</a><br>
<p>[Enter CHUBUKOV.]</p>
<a name=1.1.61><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> What's the matter? What are you shouting at?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.62><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Papa, please tell to this gentleman who owns Oxen<br>
        Meadows, we or he?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.63><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> [To LOMOV] Darling, the Meadows are ours!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.64><b>LOMOV.</b> But, please, Stepan Stepanitch, how can they be yours? Do be a<br>
        reasonable man! My aunt's grandmother gave the Meadows for the temporary<br>
        and free use of your grandfather's peasants. The peasants used the land<br>
        for forty years and got as accustomed to it as if it was their own, when<br>
        it happened that...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.65><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Excuse me, my precious.... You forget just this, that the<br>
        peasants didn't pay your grandmother and all that, because the Meadows<br>
        were in dispute, and so on. And now everybody knows that they're ours.<br>
        It means that you haven't seen the plan.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.66><b>LOMOV.</b> I'll prove to you that they're mine!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.67><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> You won't prove it, my darling.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.68><b>LOMOV.</b> I shall!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.69><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Dear one, why yell like that? You won't prove anything just by<br>
        yelling. I don't want anything of yours, and don't intend to give up<br>
        what I have. Why should I? And you know, my beloved, that if you propose<br>
        to go on arguing about it, I'd much sooner give up the meadows to the<br>
        peasants than to you. There!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.70><b>LOMOV.</b> I don't understand! How have you the right to give away somebody<br>
        else's property?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.71><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> You may take it that I know whether I have the right or not.<br>
        Because, young man, I'm not used to being spoken to in that tone of<br>
        voice, and so on: I, young man, am twice your age, and ask you to speak<br>
        to me without agitating yourself, and all that.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.72><b>LOMOV.</b> No, you just think I'm a fool and want to have me on! You call my<br>
        land yours, and then you want me to talk to you calmly and politely!<br>
        Good neighbours don't behave like that, Stepan Stepanitch! You're not a<br>
        neighbour, you're a grabber!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.73><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> What's that? What did you say?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.74><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Papa, send the mowers out to the Meadows at once!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.75><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> What did you say, sir?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.76><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Oxen Meadows are ours, and I shan't give them up,<br>
        shan't give them up, shan't give them up!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.77><b>LOMOV.</b> We'll see! I'll have the matter taken to court, and then I'll<br>
        show you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.78><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> To court? You can take it to court, and all that! You can! I<br>
        know you; you're just on the look-out for a chance to go to court, and<br>
        all that.... You pettifogger! All your people were like that! All of<br>
        them!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.79><b>LOMOV.</b> Never mind about my people! The Lomovs have all been honourable<br>
        people, and not one has ever been tried for embezzlement, like your<br>
        grandfather!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.80><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> You Lomovs have had lunacy in your family, all of you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.81><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> All, all, all!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.82><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Your grandfather was a drunkard, and your younger aunt,<br>
        Nastasya Mihailovna, ran away with an architect, and so on.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.83><b>LOMOV.</b> And your mother was hump-backed. [Clutches at his heart]<br>
        Something pulling in my side.... My head.... Help! Water!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.84><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Your father was a guzzling gambler!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.85><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> And there haven't been many backbiters to equal your<br>
        aunt!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.86><b>LOMOV.</b> My left foot has gone to sleep.... You're an intriguer.... Oh, my<br>
        heart!... And it's an open secret that before the last elections you<br>
        bri... I can see stars.... Where's my hat?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.87><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> It's low! It's dishonest! It's mean!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.88><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> And you're just a malicious, double-faced intriguer! Yes!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.89><b>LOMOV.</b> Here's my hat.... My heart!... Which way? Where's the door?<br>
        Oh!... I think I'm dying.... My foot's quite numb.... [Goes to the<br>
        door.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.90><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> [Following him] And don't set foot in my house again!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.91><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Take it to court! We'll see!</a><br>
<p>[LOMOV staggers out.]</p>
<a name=1.1.92><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Devil take him! [Walks about in excitement.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.93><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> What a rascal! What trust can one have in one's<br>
        neighbours after that!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.94><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> The villain! The scarecrow!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.95><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> The monster! First he takes our land and then he has<br>
        the impudence to abuse us.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.96><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> And that blind hen, yes, that turnip-ghost has the confounded<br>
        cheek to make a proposal, and so on! What? A proposal!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.97><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> What proposal?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.98><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Why, he came here so as to propose to you.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.99><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> To propose? To me? Why didn't you tell me so before?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.100><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> So he dresses up in evening clothes. The stuffed sausage! The<br>
        wizen-faced frump!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.101><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> To propose to me? Ah! [Falls into an easy-chair and<br>
        wails] Bring him back! Back! Ah! Bring him here.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.102><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Bring whom here?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.103><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Quick, quick! I'm ill! Fetch him! [Hysterics.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.104><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> What's that? What's the matter with you? [Clutches at his<br>
        head] Oh, unhappy man that I am! I'll shoot myself! I'll hang myself!<br>
        We've done for her!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.105><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> I'm dying! Fetch him!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.106><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Tfoo! At once. Don't yell!</a><br>
<p>[Runs out. A pause. NATALYA STEPANOVNA wails.]</p>
<a name=1.1.107><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> What have they done to me! Fetch him back! Fetch<br>
        him! [A pause.]</a><br>
<p>[CHUBUKOV runs in.]</p>
<a name=1.1.108><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> He's coming, and so on, devil take him! Ouf! Talk to him<br>
        yourself; I don't want to....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.109><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> [Wails] Fetch him!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.110><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> [Yells] He's coming, I tell you. Oh, what a burden, Lord, to<br>
        be the father of a grown-up daughter! I'll cut my throat! I will,<br>
        indeed! We cursed him, abused him, drove him out, and it's all you...<br>
        you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.111><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> No, it was you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.112><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> I tell you it's not my fault. [LOMOV appears at the door] Now<br>
        you talk to him yourself [Exit.]</a><br>
<p>[LOMOV enters, exhausted.]</p>
<a name=1.1.113><b>LOMOV.</b> My heart's palpitating awfully.... My foot's gone to sleep....<br>
        There's something keeps pulling in my side.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.114><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Forgive us, Ivan Vassilevitch, we were all a little<br>
        heated.... I remember now: Oxen Meadows really are yours.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.115><b>LOMOV.</b> My heart's beating awfully.... My Meadows.... My eyebrows are<br>
        both twitching....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.116><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> The Meadows are yours, yes, yours.... Do sit<br>
        down.... [They sit] We were wrong....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.117><b>LOMOV.</b> I did it on principle.... My land is worth little to me, but the<br>
        principle...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.118><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Yes, the principle, just so.... Now let's talk of<br>
        something else.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.119><b>LOMOV.</b> The more so as I have evidence. My aunt's grandmother gave the<br>
        land to your father's grandfather's peasants...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.120><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Yes, yes, let that pass.... [Aside] I wish I knew<br>
        how to get him started.... [Aloud] Are you going to start shooting soon?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.121><b>LOMOV.</b> I'm thinking of having a go at the blackcock, honoured Natalya<br>
        Stepanovna, after the harvest. Oh, have you heard? Just think, what a<br>
        misfortune I've had! My dog Guess, whom you know, has gone lame.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.122><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> What a pity! Why?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.123><b>LOMOV.</b> I don't know.... Must have got twisted, or bitten by some other<br>
        dog.... [Sighs] My very best dog, to say nothing of the expense. I gave<br>
        Mironov 125 roubles for him.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.124><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> It was too much, Ivan Vassilevitch.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.125><b>LOMOV.</b> I think it was very cheap. He's a first-rate dog.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.126><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Papa gave 85 roubles for his Squeezer, and Squeezer<br>
        is heaps better than Guess!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.127><b>LOMOV.</b> Squeezer better than. Guess? What an idea! [Laughs] Squeezer<br>
        better than Guess!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.128><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Of course he's better! Of course, Squeezer is young,<br>
        he may develop a bit, but on points and pedigree he's better than<br>
        anything that even Volchanetsky has got.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.129><b>LOMOV.</b> Excuse me, Natalya Stepanovna, but you forget that he is<br>
        overshot, and an overshot always means the dog is a bad hunter!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.130><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Overshot, is he? The first time I hear it!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.131><b>LOMOV.</b> I assure you that his lower jaw is shorter than the upper.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.132><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Have you measured?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.133><b>LOMOV.</b> Yes. He's all right at following, of course, but if you want him<br>
        to get hold of anything...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.134><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> In the first place, our Squeezer is a thoroughbred<br>
        animal, the son of Harness and Chisels, while there's no getting at the<br>
        pedigree of your dog at all.... He's old and as ugly as a worn-out<br>
        cab-horse.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.135><b>LOMOV.</b> He is old, but I wouldn't take five Squeezers for him.... Why,<br>
        how can you?... Guess is a dog; as for Squeezer, well, it's too funny to<br>
        argue.... Anybody you like has a dog as good as Squeezer... you may find<br>
        them under every bush almost. Twenty-five roubles would be a handsome<br>
        price to pay for him.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.136><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> There's some demon of contradiction in you to-day,<br>
        Ivan Vassilevitch. First you pretend that the Meadows are yours; now,<br>
        that Guess is better than Squeezer. I don't like people who don't say<br>
        what they mean, because you know perfectly well that Squeezer is a<br>
        hundred times better than your silly Guess. Why do you want to say it<br>
        isn't?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.137><b>LOMOV.</b> I see, Natalya Stepanovna, that you consider me either blind or a<br>
        fool. You must realize that Squeezer is overshot!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.138><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> It's not true.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.139><b>LOMOV.</b> He is!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.140><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> It's not true!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.141><b>LOMOV.</b> Why shout, madam?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.142><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Why talk rot? It's awful! It's time your Guess was<br>
        shot, and you compare him with Squeezer!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.143><b>LOMOV.</b> Excuse me; I cannot continue this discussion: my heart is<br>
        palpitating.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.144><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> I've noticed that those hunters argue most who know<br>
        least.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.145><b>LOMOV.</b> Madam, please be silent.... My heart is going to pieces....<br>
        [Shouts] Shut up!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.146><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> I shan't shut up until you acknowledge that Squeezer<br>
        is a hundred times better than your Guess!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.147><b>LOMOV.</b> A hundred times worse! Be hanged to your Squeezer! His head...<br>
        eyes... shoulder...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.148><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> There's no need to hang your silly Guess; he's<br>
        half-dead already!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.149><b>LOMOV.</b> [Weeps] Shut up! My heart's bursting!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.150><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> I shan't shut up.</a><br>
<p>[Enter CHUBUKOV.]</p>
<a name=1.1.151><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> What's the matter now?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.152><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Papa, tell us truly, which is the better dog, our<br>
        Squeezer or his Guess.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.153><b>LOMOV.</b> Stepan Stepanovitch, I implore you to tell me just one thing: is<br>
        your Squeezer overshot or not? Yes or no?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.154><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> And suppose he is? What does it matter? He's the best dog in<br>
        the district for all that, and so on.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.155><b>LOMOV.</b> But isn't my Guess better? Really, now?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.156><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Don't excite yourself, my precious one.... Allow me.... Your<br>
        Guess certainly has his good points.... He's pure-bred, firm on his<br>
        feet, has well-sprung ribs, and all that. But, my dear man, if you want<br>
        to know the truth, that dog has two defects: he's old and he's short in<br>
        the muzzle.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.157><b>LOMOV.</b> Excuse me, my heart.... Let's take the facts.... You will<br>
        remember that on the Marusinsky hunt my Guess ran neck-and-neck with the<br>
        Count's dog, while your Squeezer was left a whole verst behind.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.158><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> He got left behind because the Count's whipper-in hit him with<br>
        his whip.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.159><b>LOMOV.</b> And with good reason. The dogs are running after a fox, when<br>
        Squeezer goes and starts worrying a sheep!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.160><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> It's not true!... My dear fellow, I'm very liable to lose my<br>
        temper, and so, just because of that, let's stop arguing. You started<br>
        because everybody is always jealous of everybody else's dogs. Yes, we're<br>
        all like that! You too, sir, aren't blameless! You no sooner notice that<br>
        some dog is better than your Guess than you begin with this, that... and<br>
        the other... and all that.... I remember everything!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.161><b>LOMOV.</b> I remember too!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.162><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> [Teasing him] I remember, too.... What do you remember?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.163><b>LOMOV.</b> My heart... my foot's gone to sleep.... I can't...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.164><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> [Teasing] My heart.... What sort of a hunter are<br>
        you? You ought to go and lie on the kitchen oven and catch blackbeetles,<br>
        not go after foxes! My heart!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.165><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Yes really, what sort of a hunter are you, anyway? You ought<br>
        to sit at home with your palpitations, and not go tracking animals. You<br>
        could go hunting, but you only go to argue with people and interfere<br>
        with their dogs and so on. Let's change the subject in case I lose my<br>
        temper. You're not a hunter at all, anyway!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.166><b>LOMOV.</b> And are you a hunter? You only go hunting to get in with the<br>
        Count and to intrigue.... Oh, my heart!... You're an intriguer!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.167><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> What? I an intriguer? [Shouts] Shut up!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.168><b>LOMOV.</b> Intriguer!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.169><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Boy! Pup!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.170><b>LOMOV.</b> Old rat! Jesuit!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.171><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Shut up or I'll shoot you like a partridge! You fool!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.172><b>LOMOV.</b> Everybody knows that&mdash;oh my heart!&mdash;your late wife used<br>
        to beat you.... My feet... temples... sparks.... I fall, I fall!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.173><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> And you're under the slipper of your housekeeper!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.174><b>LOMOV.</b> There, there, there... my heart's burst! My shoulder's come<br>
        off.... Where is my shoulder? I die. [Falls into an armchair] A doctor!<br>
        [Faints.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.175><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Boy! Milksop! Fool! I'm sick! [Drinks water] Sick!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.176><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> What sort of a hunter are you? You can't even sit on<br>
        a horse! [To her father] Papa, what's the matter with him? Papa! Look,<br>
        papa! [Screams] Ivan Vassilevitch! He's dead!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.177><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> I'm sick!... I can't breathe!... Air!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.178><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> He's dead. [Pulls LOMOV'S sleeve] Ivan Vassilevitch!<br>
        Ivan Vassilevitch! What have you done to me? He's dead. [Falls into an<br>
        armchair] A doctor, a doctor! [Hysterics.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.179><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Oh!... What is it? What's the matter?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.180><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> [Wails] He's dead... dead!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.181><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Who's dead? [Looks at LOMOV] So he is! My word! Water! A<br>
        doctor! [Lifts a tumbler to LOMOV'S mouth] Drink this!... No, he doesn't<br>
        drink.... It means he's dead, and all that.... I'm the most unhappy of<br>
        men! Why don't I put a bullet into my brain? Why haven't I cut my throat<br>
        yet? What am I waiting for? Give me a knife! Give me a pistol! [LOMOV<br>
        moves] He seems to be coming round.... Drink some water! That's<br>
        right....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.182><b>LOMOV.</b> I see stars... mist.... Where am I?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.183><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Hurry up and get married and&mdash;well, to the devil with<br>
        you! She's willing! [He puts LOMOV'S hand into his daughter's] She's<br>
        willing and all that. I give you my blessing and so on. Only leave me in<br>
        peace!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.184><b>LOMOV.</b> [Getting up] Eh? What? To whom?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.185><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> She's willing! Well? Kiss and be damned to you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.186><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> [Wails] He's alive... Yes, yes, I'm willing....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.187><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Kiss each other!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.188><b>LOMOV.</b> Eh? Kiss whom? [They kiss] Very nice, too. Excuse me, what's it<br>
        all about? Oh, now I understand... my heart... stars... I'm happy.<br>
        Natalya Stepanovna.... [Kisses her hand] My foot's gone to sleep....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.189><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> I... I'm happy too....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.190><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> What a weight off my shoulders.... Ouf!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.191><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> But... still you will admit now that Guess is worse<br>
        than Squeezer.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.192><b>LOMOV.</b> Better!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.193><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Worse!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.194><b>CHUBUKOV.</b> Well, that's a way to start your family bliss! Have some<br>
        champagne!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.195><b>LOMOV.</b> He's better!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.196><b>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</b> Worse! worse! worse!</a><br>
