<h2>THE BEAR</h2>
<p>[A drawing-room in POPOVA'S house.]</p>
<p>[POPOVA is in deep mourning and has her eyes fixed on a photograph. LUKA<br>
        is haranguing her.]</p>
<a name=1.1.1><b>LUKA.</b> It isn't right, madam.... You're just destroying yourself. The<br>
        maid and the cook have gone off fruit picking, every living being is<br>
        rejoicing, even the cat understands how to enjoy herself and walks about<br>
        in the yard, catching midges; only you sit in this room all day, as if<br>
        this was a convent, and don't take any pleasure. Yes, really! I reckon<br>
        it's a whole year that you haven't left the house!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.2><b>POPOVA.</b> I shall never go out.... Why should I? My life is already at an<br>
        end. He is in his grave, and I have buried myself between four walls....<br>
        We are both dead.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.3><b>LUKA.</b> Well, there you are! Nicolai Mihailovitch is dead, well, it's the<br>
        will of God, and may his soul rest in peace.... You've mourned him&mdash;and<br>
        quite right. But you can't go on weeping and wearing mourning for ever.<br>
        My old woman died too, when her time came. Well? I grieved over her, I<br>
        wept for a month, and that's enough for her, but if I've got to weep for<br>
        a whole age, well, the old woman isn't worth it. [Sighs] You've<br>
        forgotten all your neighbours. You don't go anywhere, and you see<br>
        nobody. We live, so to speak, like spiders, and never see the light. The<br>
        mice have eaten my livery. It isn't as if there were no good people<br>
        around, for the district's full of them. There's a regiment quartered at<br>
        Riblov, and the officers are such beauties&mdash;you can never gaze your<br>
        fill at them. And, every Friday, there's a ball at the camp, and every<br>
        day the soldier's band plays.... Eh, my lady! You're young and<br>
        beautiful, with roses in your cheek&mdash;if you only took a little<br>
        pleasure. Beauty won't last long, you know. In ten years' time you'll<br>
        want to be a pea-hen yourself among the officers, but they won't look at<br>
        you, it will be too late.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.4><b>POPOVA.</b> [With determination] I must ask you never to talk to me about<br>
        it! You know that when Nicolai Mihailovitch died, life lost all its<br>
        meaning for me. I vowed never to the end of my days to cease to wear<br>
        mourning, or to see the light.... You hear? Let his ghost see how well I<br>
        love him.... Yes, I know it's no secret to you that he was often unfair<br>
        to me, cruel, and... and even unfaithful, but I shall be true till<br>
        death, and show him how I can love. There, beyond the grave, he will see<br>
        me as I was before his death....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.5><b>LUKA.</b> Instead of talking like that you ought to go and have a walk in<br>
        the garden, or else order Toby or Giant to be harnessed, and then drive<br>
        out to see some of the neighbours.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.6><b>POPOVA.</b> Oh! [Weeps.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.7><b>LUKA.</b> Madam! Dear madam! What is it? Bless you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.8><b>POPOVA.</b> He was so fond of Toby! He always used to ride on him to the<br>
        Korchagins and Vlasovs. How well he could ride! What grace there was in<br>
        his figure when he pulled at the reins with all his strength! Do you<br>
        remember? Toby, Toby! Tell them to give him an extra feed of oats.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.9><b>LUKA.</b> Yes, madam. [A bell rings noisily.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.10><b>POPOVA.</b> [Shaking] Who's that? Tell them that I receive nobody.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.11><b>LUKA.</b> Yes, madam. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.12><b>POPOVA.</b> [Looks at the photograph] You will see, Nicolas, how I can love<br>
        and forgive.... My love will die out with me, only when this poor heart<br>
        will cease to beat. [Laughs through her tears] And aren't you ashamed? I<br>
        am a good and virtuous little wife. I've locked myself in, and will be<br>
        true to you till the grave, and you... aren't you ashamed, you bad<br>
        child? You deceived me, had rows with me, left me alone for weeks on<br>
        end....</a><br>
<p>[LUKA enters in consternation.]</p>
<a name=1.1.13><b>LUKA.</b> Madam, somebody is asking for you. He wants to see you....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.14><b>POPOVA.</b> But didn't you tell him that since the death of my husband I've<br>
        stopped receiving?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.15><b>LUKA.</b> I did, but he wouldn't even listen; says that it's a very pressing<br>
        affair.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.16><b>POPOVA.</b> I do not re-ceive!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.17><b>LUKA.</b> I told him so, but the... the devil... curses and pushes himself<br>
        right in.... He's in the dining-room now.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.18><b>POPOVA.</b> [Annoyed] Very well, ask him in.... What manners! [Exit LUKA]<br>
        How these people annoy me! What does he want of me? Why should he<br>
        disturb my peace? [Sighs] No, I see that I shall have to go into a<br>
        convent after all. [Thoughtfully] Yes, into a convent.... [Enter LUKA<br>
        with SMIRNOV.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.19><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [To LUKA] You fool, you're too fond of talking.... Ass! [Sees<br>
        POPOVA and speaks with respect] Madam, I have the honour to present<br>
        myself, I am Grigory Stepanovitch Smirnov, landowner and retired<br>
        lieutenant of artillery! I am compelled to disturb you on a very<br>
        pressing affair.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.20><b>POPOVA.</b> [Not giving him her hand] What do you want?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.21><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Your late husband, with whom I had the honour of being<br>
        acquainted, died in my debt for one thousand two hundred roubles, on two<br>
        bills of exchange. As I've got to pay the interest on a mortgage<br>
        to-morrow, I've come to ask you, madam, to pay me the money to-day.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.22><b>POPOVA.</b> One thousand two hundred.... And what was my husband in debt to<br>
        you for?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.23><b>SMIRNOV.</b> He used to buy oats from me.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.24><b>POPOVA.</b> [Sighing, to LUKA] So don't you forget, Luka, to give Toby an<br>
        extra feed of oats. [Exit LUKA] If Nicolai Mihailovitch died in debt to<br>
        you, then I shall certainly pay you, but you must excuse me to-day, as I<br>
        haven't any spare cash. The day after to-morrow my steward will be back<br>
        from town, and I'll give him instructions to settle your account, but at<br>
        the moment I cannot do as you wish.... Moreover, it's exactly seven<br>
        months to-day since the death of my husband, and I'm in a state of mind<br>
        which absolutely prevents me from giving money matters my attention.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.25><b>SMIRNOV.</b> And I'm in a state of mind which, if I don't pay the interest<br>
        due to-morrow, will force me to make a graceful exit from this life feet<br>
        first. They'll take my estate!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.26><b>POPOVA.</b> You'll have your money the day after to-morrow.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.27><b>SMIRNOV.</b> I don't want the money the day after tomorrow, I want it<br>
        to-day.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.28><b>POPOVA.</b> You must excuse me, I can't pay you.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.29><b>SMIRNOV.</b> And I can't wait till after to-morrow.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.30><b>POPOVA.</b> Well, what can I do, if I haven't the money now!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.31><b>SMIRNOV.</b> You mean to say, you can't pay me?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.32><b>POPOVA.</b> I can't.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.33><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Hm! Is that the last word you've got to say?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.34><b>POPOVA.</b> Yes, the last word.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.35><b>SMIRNOV.</b> The last word? Absolutely your last?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.36><b>POPOVA.</b> Absolutely.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.37><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Thank you so much. I'll make a note of it. [Shrugs his<br>
        shoulders] And then people want me to keep calm! I meet a man on the<br>
        road, and he asks me "Why are you always so angry, Grigory<br>
        Stepanovitch?" But how on earth am I not to get angry? I want the money<br>
        desperately. I rode out yesterday, early in the morning, and called on<br>
        all my debtors, and not a single one of them paid up! I was just about<br>
        dead-beat after it all, slept, goodness knows where, in some inn, kept<br>
        by a Jew, with a vodka-barrel by my head. At last I get here, seventy<br>
        versts from home, and hope to get something, and I am received by you<br>
        with a "state of mind"! How shouldn't I get angry.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.38><b>POPOVA.</b> I thought I distinctly said my steward will pay you when he<br>
        returns from town.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.39><b>SMIRNOV.</b> I didn't come to your steward, but to you! What the devil,<br>
        excuse my saying so, have I to do with your steward!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.40><b>POPOVA.</b> Excuse me, sir, I am not accustomed to listen to such<br>
        expressions or to such a tone of voice. I want to hear no more. [Makes a<br>
        rapid exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.41><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Well, there! "A state of mind."... "Husband died seven months<br>
        ago!" Must I pay the interest, or mustn't I? I ask you: Must I pay, or<br>
        must I not? Suppose your husband is dead, and you've got a state of<br>
        mind, and nonsense of that sort.... And your steward's gone away<br>
        somewhere, devil take him, what do you want me to do? Do you think I can<br>
        fly away from my creditors in a balloon, or what? Or do you expect me to<br>
        go and run my head into a brick wall? I go to Grusdev and he isn't at<br>
        home, Yaroshevitch has hidden himself, I had a violent row with Kuritsin<br>
        and nearly threw him out of the window, Mazugo has something the matter<br>
        with his bowels, and this woman has "a state of mind." Not one of the<br>
        swine wants to pay me! Just because I'm too gentle with them, because<br>
        I'm a rag, just weak wax in their hands! I'm much too gentle with them!<br>
        Well, just you wait! You'll find out what I'm like! I shan't let you<br>
        play about with me, confound it! I shall jolly well stay here until she<br>
        pays! Brr!... How angry I am to-day, how angry I am! All my inside is<br>
        quivering with anger, and I can't even breathe.... Foo, my word, I even<br>
        feel sick! [Yells] Waiter!</a><br>
<p>[Enter LUKA.]</p>
<a name=1.1.42><b>LUKA.</b> What is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.43><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Get me some kvass or water! [Exit LUKA] What a way to reason! A<br>
        man is in desperate need of his money, and she won't pay it because, you<br>
        see, she is not disposed to attend to money matters!... That's real<br>
        silly feminine logic. That's why I never did like, and don't like now,<br>
        to have to talk to women. I'd rather sit on a barrel of gunpowder than<br>
        talk to a woman. Brr!... I feel quite chilly&mdash;and it's all on<br>
        account of that little bit of fluff! I can't even see one of these<br>
        poetic creatures from a distance without breaking out into a cold sweat<br>
        out of sheer anger. I can't look at them. [Enter LUKA with water.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.44><b>LUKA.</b> Madam is ill and will see nobody.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.45><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Get out! [Exit LUKA] Ill and will see nobody! No, it's all<br>
        right, you don't see me.... I'm going to stay and will sit here till you<br>
        give me the money. You can be ill for a week, if you like, and I'll stay<br>
        here for a week.... If you're ill for a year&mdash;I'll stay for a year.<br>
        I'm going to get my own, my dear! You don't get at me with your widow's<br>
        weeds and your dimpled cheeks! I know those dimples! [Shouts through the<br>
        window] Simeon, take them out! We aren't going away at once! I'm staying<br>
        here! Tell them in the stable to give the horses some oats! You fool,<br>
        you've let the near horse's leg get tied up in the reins again!<br>
        [Teasingly] "Never mind...." I'll give it you. "Never mind." [Goes away<br>
        from the window] Oh, it's bad.... The heat's frightful, nobody pays up.<br>
        I slept badly, and on top of everything else here's a bit of fluff in<br>
        mourning with "a state of mind."... My head's aching.... Shall I have<br>
        some vodka, what? Yes, I think I will. [Yells] Waiter!</a><br>
<p>[Enter LUKA.]</p>
<a name=1.1.46><b>LUKA.</b> What is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.47><b>SMIRNOV.</b> A glass of vodka! [Exit LUKA] Ouf! [Sits and inspects himself]<br>
        I must say I look well! Dust all over, boots dirty, unwashed, unkempt,<br>
        straw on my waistcoat.... The dear lady may well have taken me for a<br>
        brigand. [Yawns] It's rather impolite to come into a drawing-room in<br>
        this state, but it can't be helped.... I am not here as a visitor, but<br>
        as a creditor, and there's no dress specially prescribed for<br>
        creditors....</a><br>
<p>[Enter LUKA with the vodka.]</p>
<a name=1.1.48><b>LUKA.</b> You allow yourself to go very far, sir....</a><br>
<p>SMIRNOV [Angrily] What?</p>
<a name=1.1.49><b>LUKA.</b> I... er... nothing... I really...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.50><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Whom are you talking to? Shut up!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.51><b>LUKA.</b> [Aside] The devil's come to stay.... Bad luck that brought him....<br>
        [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.52><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Oh, how angry I am! So angry that I think I could grind the<br>
        whole world to dust.... I even feel sick.... [Yells] Waiter!</a><br>
<p>[Enter POPOVA.]</p>
<a name=1.1.53><b>POPOVA.</b> [Her eyes downcast] Sir, in my solitude I have grown<br>
        unaccustomed to the masculine voice, and I can't stand shouting. I must<br>
        ask you not to disturb my peace.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.54><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Pay me the money, and I'll go.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.55><b>POPOVA.</b> I told you perfectly plainly; I haven't any money to spare; wait<br>
        until the day after to-morrow.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.56><b>SMIRNOV.</b> And I told you perfectly plainly I don't want the money the day<br>
        after to-morrow, but to-day. If you don't pay me to-day, I'll have to<br>
        hang myself to-morrow.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.57><b>POPOVA.</b> But what can I do if I haven't got the money? You're so strange!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.58><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Then you won't pay me now? Eh?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.59><b>POPOVA.</b> I can't.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.60><b>SMIRNOV.</b> In that case I stay here and shall wait until I get it. [Sits<br>
        down] You're going to pay me the day after to-morrow? Very well! I'll<br>
        stay here until the day after to-morrow. I'll sit here all the time....<br>
        [Jumps up] I ask you: Have I got to pay the interest to-morrow, or<br>
        haven't I? Or do you think I'm doing this for a joke?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.61><b>POPOVA.</b> Please don't shout! This isn't a stable!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.62><b>SMIRNOV.</b> I wasn't asking you about a stable, but whether I'd got my<br>
        interest to pay to-morrow or not?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.63><b>POPOVA.</b> You don't know how to behave before women!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.64><b>SMIRNOV.</b> No, I do know how to behave before women!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.65><b>POPOVA.</b> No, you don't! You're a rude, ill-bred man! Decent people don't<br>
        talk to a woman like that!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.66><b>SMIRNOV.</b> What a business! How do you want me to talk to you? In French,<br>
        or what? [Loses his temper and lisps]Madame, je vous prie....<br>
        How happy I am that you don't pay me.... Ah, pardon. I have disturbed<br>
        you! Such lovely weather to-day! And how well you look in mourning!<br>
        [Bows.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.67><b>POPOVA.</b> That's silly and rude.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.68><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [Teasing her] Silly and rude! I don't know how to behave before<br>
        women! Madam, in my time I've seen more women than you've seen sparrows!<br>
        Three times I've fought duels on account of women. I've refused twelve<br>
        women, and nine have refused me! Yes! There was a time when I played the<br>
        fool, scented myself, used honeyed words, wore jewellery, made beautiful<br>
        bows. I used to love, to suffer, to sigh at the moon, to get sour, to<br>
        thaw, to freeze.... I used to love passionately, madly, every blessed<br>
        way, devil take me; I used to chatter like a magpie about emancipation,<br>
        and wasted half my wealth on tender feelings, but now&mdash;you must<br>
        excuse me! You won't get round me like that now! I've had enough! Black<br>
        eyes, passionate eyes, ruby lips, dimpled cheeks, the moon, whispers,<br>
        timid breathing&mdash;I wouldn't give a brass farthing for the lot,<br>
        madam! Present company always excepted, all women, great or little, are<br>
        insincere, crooked, backbiters, envious, liars to the marrow of their<br>
        bones, vain, trivial, merciless, unreasonable, and, as far as this is<br>
        concerned [taps his forehead] excuse my outspokenness, a sparrow can<br>
        give ten points to any philosopher in petticoats you like to name! You<br>
        look at one of these poetic creatures: all muslin, an ethereal<br>
        demi-goddess, you have a million transports of joy, and you look into<br>
        her soul&mdash;and see a common crocodile! [He grips the back of a<br>
        chair; the chair creaks and breaks] But the most disgusting thing of all<br>
        is that this crocodile for some reason or other imagines that its chef<br>
        d'oeuvre, its privilege and monopoly, is its tender feelings. Why,<br>
        confound it, hang me on that nail feet upwards, if you like, but have<br>
        you met a woman who can love anybody except a lapdog? When she's in<br>
        love, can she do anything but snivel and slobber? While a man is<br>
        suffering and making sacrifices all her love expresses itself in her<br>
        playing about with her scarf, and trying to hook him more firmly by the<br>
        nose. You have the misfortune to be a woman, you know from yourself what<br>
        is the nature of woman. Tell me truthfully, have you ever seen a woman<br>
        who was sincere, faithful, and constant? You haven't! Only freaks and<br>
        old women are faithful and constant! You'll meet a cat with a horn or a<br>
        white woodcock sooner than a constant woman!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.69><b>POPOVA.</b> Then, according to you, who is faithful and constant in love? Is<br>
        it the man?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.70><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Yes, the man!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.71><b>POPOVA.</b> The man! [Laughs bitterly] Men are faithful and constant in<br>
        love! What an idea! [With heat] What right have you to talk like that?<br>
        Men are faithful and constant! Since we are talking about it, I'll tell<br>
        you that of all the men I knew and know, the best was my late<br>
        husband.... I loved him passionately with all my being, as only a young<br>
        and imaginative woman can love, I gave him my youth, my happiness, my<br>
        life, my fortune, I breathed in him, I worshipped him as if I were a<br>
        heathen, and... and what then? This best of men shamelessly deceived me<br>
        at every step! After his death I found in his desk a whole drawerful of<br>
        love-letters, and when he was alive&mdash;it's an awful thing to<br>
        remember!&mdash;he used to leave me alone for weeks at a time, and make<br>
        love to other women and betray me before my very eyes; he wasted my<br>
        money, and made fun of my feelings.... And, in spite of all that, I<br>
        loved him and was true to him. And not only that, but, now that he is<br>
        dead, I am still true and constant to his memory. I have shut myself for<br>
        ever within these four walls, and will wear these weeds to the very<br>
        end....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.72><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [Laughs contemptuously] Weeds!... I don't understand what you<br>
        take me for. As if I don't know why you wear that black domino and bury<br>
        yourself between four walls! I should say I did! It's so mysterious, so<br>
        poetic! When some junker [Note: So in the original.] or some tame poet<br>
        goes past your windows he'll think: "There lives the mysterious Tamara<br>
        who, for the love of her husband, buried herself between four walls." We<br>
        know these games!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.73><b>POPOVA.</b> [Exploding] What? How dare you say all that to me?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.74><b>SMIRNOV.</b> You may have buried yourself alive, but you haven't forgotten<br>
        to powder your face!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.75><b>POPOVA.</b> How dare you speak to me like that?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.76><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Please don't shout, I'm not your steward! You must allow me to<br>
        call things by their real names. I'm not a woman, and I'm used to saying<br>
        what I think straight out! Don't you shout, either!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.77><b>POPOVA.</b> I'm not shouting, it's you! Please leave me alone!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.78><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Pay me my money and I'll go.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.79><b>POPOVA.</b> I shan't give you any money!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.80><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Oh, no, you will.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.81><b>POPOVA.</b> I shan't give you a farthing, just to spite you. You leave me<br>
        alone!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.82><b>SMIRNOV.</b> I have not the pleasure of being either your husband or your<br>
        fiancÈ, so please don't make scenes. [Sits] I don't like it.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.83><b>POPOVA.</b> [Choking with rage] So you sit down?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.84><b>SMIRNOV.</b> I do.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.85><b>POPOVA.</b> I ask you to go away!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.86><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Give me my money.... [Aside] Oh, how angry I am! How angry I<br>
        am!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.87><b>POPOVA.</b> I don't want to talk to impudent scoundrels! Get out of this!<br>
        [Pause] Aren't you going? No?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.88><b>SMIRNOV.</b> No.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.89><b>POPOVA.</b> No?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.90><b>SMIRNOV.</b> No!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.91><b>POPOVA.</b> Very well then! [Rings, enter LUKA] Luka, show this gentleman<br>
        out!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.92><b>LUKA.</b> [Approaches SMIRNOV] Would you mind going out, sir, as you're<br>
        asked to! You needn't...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.93><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [Jumps up] Shut up! Who are you talking to? I'll chop you into<br>
        pieces!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.94><b>LUKA.</b> [Clutches at his heart] Little fathers!... What people!... [Falls<br>
        into a chair] Oh, I'm ill, I'm ill! I can't breathe!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.95><b>POPOVA.</b> Where's Dasha? Dasha! [Shouts] Dasha! Pelageya! Dasha! [Rings.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.96><b>LUKA.</b> Oh! They've all gone out to pick fruit.... There's nobody at home!<br>
        I'm ill! Water!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.97><b>POPOVA.</b> Get out of this, now.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.98><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Can't you be more polite?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.99><b>POPOVA.</b> [Clenches her fists and stamps her foot] You're a boor! A coarse<br>
        bear! A Bourbon! A monster!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.100><b>SMIRNOV.</b> What? What did you say?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.101><b>POPOVA.</b> I said you are a bear, a monster!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.102><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [Approaching her] May I ask what right you have to insult me?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.103><b>POPOVA.</b> And suppose I am insulting you? Do you think I'm afraid of you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.104><b>SMIRNOV.</b> And do you think that just because you're a poetic creature you<br>
        can insult me with impunity? Eh? We'll fight it out!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.105><b>LUKA.</b> Little fathers!... What people!... Water!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.106><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Pistols!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.107><b>POPOVA.</b> Do you think I'm afraid of you just because you have large fists<br>
        and a bull's throat? Eh? You Bourbon!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.108><b>SMIRNOV.</b> We'll fight it out! I'm not going to be insulted by anybody,<br>
        and I don't care if you are a woman, one of the "softer sex," indeed!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.109><b>POPOVA.</b> [Trying to interrupt him] Bear! Bear! Bear!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.110><b>SMIRNOV.</b> It's about time we got rid of the prejudice that only men need<br>
        pay for their insults. Devil take it, if you want equality of rights you<br>
        can have it. We're going to fight it out!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.111><b>POPOVA.</b> With pistols? Very well!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.112><b>SMIRNOV.</b> This very minute.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.113><b>POPOVA.</b> This very minute! My husband had some pistols.... I'll bring<br>
        them here. [Is going, but turns back] What pleasure it will give me to<br>
        put a bullet into your thick head! Devil take you! [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.114><b>SMIRNOV.</b> I'll bring her down like a chicken! I'm not a little boy or a<br>
        sentimental puppy; I don't care about this "softer sex."</a><br>
<a name=1.1.115><b>LUKA.</b> Gracious little fathers!... [Kneels] Have pity on a poor old man,<br>
        and go away from here! You've frightened her to death, and now you want<br>
        to shoot her!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.116><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [Not hearing him] If she fights, well that's equality of<br>
        rights, emancipation, and all that! Here the sexes are equal! I'll shoot<br>
        her on principle! But what a woman! [Parodying her] "Devil take you!<br>
        I'll put a bullet into your thick head." Eh? How she reddened, how her<br>
        cheeks shone!... She accepted my challenge! My word, it's the first time<br>
        in my life that I've seen....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.117><b>LUKA.</b> Go away, sir, and I'll always pray to God for you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.118><b>SMIRNOV.</b> She is a woman! That's the sort I can understand! A real woman!<br>
        Not a sour-faced jellybag, but fire, gunpowder, a rocket! I'm even sorry<br>
        to have to kill her!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.119><b>LUKA.</b> [Weeps] Dear... dear sir, do go away!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.120><b>SMIRNOV.</b> I absolutely like her! Absolutely! Even though her cheeks are<br>
        dimpled, I like her! I'm almost ready to let the debt go... and I'm not<br>
        angry any longer.... Wonderful woman!</a><br>
<p>[Enter POPOVA with pistols.]</p>
<a name=1.1.121><b>POPOVA.</b> Here are the pistols.... But before we fight you must show me<br>
        how to fire. I've never held a pistol in my hands before.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.122><b>LUKA.</b> Oh, Lord, have mercy and save her.... I'll go and find the<br>
        coachman and the gardener.... Why has this infliction come on us....<br>
        [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.123><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [Examining the pistols] You see, there are several sorts of<br>
        pistols.... There are Mortimer pistols, specially made for duels, they<br>
        fire a percussion-cap. These are Smith and Wesson revolvers, triple<br>
        action, with extractors.... These are excellent pistols. They can't cost<br>
        less than ninety roubles the pair.... You must hold the revolver like<br>
        this.... [Aside] Her eyes, her eyes! What an inspiring woman!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.124><b>POPOVA.</b> Like this?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.125><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Yes, like this.... Then you cock the trigger, and take aim like<br>
        this.... Put your head back a little! Hold your arm out properly....<br>
        Like that.... Then you press this thing with your finger&mdash;and<br>
        that's all. The great thing is to keep cool and aim steadily.... Try not<br>
        to jerk your arm.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.126><b>POPOVA.</b> Very well.... It's inconvenient to shoot in a room, let's go<br>
        into the garden.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.127><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Come along then. But I warn you, I'm going to fire in the air.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.128><b>POPOVA.</b> That's the last straw! Why?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.129><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Because... because... it's my affair.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.130><b>POPOVA.</b> Are you afraid? Yes? Ah! No, sir, you don't get out of it! You<br>
        come with me! I shan't have any peace until I've made a hole in your<br>
        forehead... that forehead which I hate so much! Are you afraid?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.131><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Yes, I am afraid.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.132><b>POPOVA.</b> You lie! Why won't you fight?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.133><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Because... because you... because I like you.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.134><b>POPOVA.</b> [Laughs] He likes me! He dares to say that he likes me! [Points<br>
        to the door] That's the way.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.135><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [Loads the revolver in silence, takes his cap and goes to the<br>
        door. There he stops for half a minute, while they look at each other in<br>
        silence, then he hesitatingly approaches POPOVA] Listen.... Are you<br>
        still angry? I'm devilishly annoyed, too... but, do you understand...<br>
        how can I express myself?... The fact is, you see, it's like this, so to<br>
        speak.... [Shouts] Well, is it my fault that I like you? [He snatches at<br>
        the back of a chair; the chair creaks and breaks] Devil take it, how I'm<br>
        smashing up your furniture! I like you! Do you understand? I... I almost<br>
        love you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.136><b>POPOVA.</b> Get away from me&mdash;I hate you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.137><b>SMIRNOV.</b> God, what a woman! I've never in my life seen one like her! I'm<br>
        lost! Done for! Fallen into a mousetrap, like a mouse!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.138><b>POPOVA.</b> Stand back, or I'll fire!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.139><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Fire, then! You can't understand what happiness it would be to<br>
        die before those beautiful eyes, to be shot by a revolver held in that<br>
        little, velvet hand.... I'm out of my senses! Think, and make up your<br>
        mind at once, because if I go out we shall never see each other again!<br>
        Decide now.... I am a landowner, of respectable character, have an<br>
        income of ten thousand a year. I can put a bullet through a coin tossed<br>
        into the air as it comes down.... I own some fine horses.... Will you be<br>
        my wife?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.140><b>POPOVA.</b> [Indignantly shakes her revolver] Let's fight! Let's go out!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.141><b>SMIRNOV.</b> I'm mad.... I understand nothing. [Yells] Waiter, water!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.142><b>POPOVA.</b> [Yells] Let's go out and fight!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.143><b>SMIRNOV.</b> I'm off my head, I'm in love like a boy, like a fool! [Snatches<br>
        her hand, she screams with pain] I love you! [Kneels] I love you as I've<br>
        never loved before! I've refused twelve women, nine have refused me, but<br>
        I never loved one of them as I love you.... I'm weak, I'm wax, I've<br>
        melted.... I'm on my knees like a fool, offering you my hand.... Shame,<br>
        shame! I haven't been in love for five years, I'd taken a vow, and now<br>
        all of a sudden I'm in love, like a fish out of water! I offer you my<br>
        hand. Yes or no? You don't want me? Very well! [Gets up and quickly goes<br>
        to the door.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.144><b>POPOVA.</b> Stop.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.145><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [Stops] Well?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.146><b>POPOVA.</b> Nothing, go away.... No, stop.... No, go away, go away! I hate<br>
        you! Or no.... Don't go away! Oh, if you knew how angry I am, how angry<br>
        I am! [Throws her revolver on the table] My fingers have swollen because<br>
        of all this.... [Tears her handkerchief in temper] What are you waiting<br>
        for? Get out!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.147><b>SMIRNOV.</b> Good-bye.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.148><b>POPOVA.</b> Yes, yes, go away!... [Yells] Where are you going? Stop.... No,<br>
        go away. Oh, how angry I am! Don't come near me, don't come near me!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.149><b>SMIRNOV.</b> [Approaching her] How angry I am with myself! I'm in love like<br>
        a student, I've been on my knees.... [Rudely] I love you! What do I want<br>
        to fall in love with you for? To-morrow I've got to pay the interest,<br>
        and begin mowing, and here you.... [Puts his arms around her] I shall<br>
        never forgive myself for this....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.150><b>POPOVA.</b> Get away from me! Take your hands away! I hate you! Let's go and<br>
        fight!</a><br>
<p>[A prolonged kiss. Enter LUKA with an axe, the GARDENER with a rake, the<br>
        COACHMAN with a pitchfork, and WORKMEN with poles.]</p>
<a name=1.1.151><b>LUKA.</b> [Catches sight of the pair kissing] Little fathers! [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.152><b>POPOVA.</b> [Lowering her eyes] Luka, tell them in the stables that Toby<br>
        isn't to have any oats at all to-day.</a><br>
<p>Curtain.</p>
