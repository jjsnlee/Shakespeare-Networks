<h2>ON THE HIGH ROAD</h2>
<p>The action takes place in one of the provinces of Southern Russia</p>
<p>[The scene is laid in TIHON'S bar. On the right is the bar-counter and<br>
        shelves with bottles. At the back is a door leading out of the house.<br>
        Over it, on the outside, hangs a dirty red lantern. The floor and the<br>
        forms, which stand against the wall, are closely occupied by pilgrims<br>
        and passers-by. Many of them, for lack of space, are sleeping as they<br>
        sit. It is late at night. As the curtain rises thunder is heard, and<br>
        lightning is seen through the door.]</p>
<p>[TIHON is behind the counter. FEDYA is half-lying in a heap on one of<br>
        the forms, and is quietly playing on a concertina. Next to him is<br>
        BORTSOV, wearing a shabby summer overcoat. SAVVA, NAZAROVNA, and<br>
        EFIMOVNA are stretched out on the floor by the benches.]</p>
<a name=1.1.1><b>EFIMOVNA.</b> [To NAZAROVNA] Give the old man a nudge dear! Can't get any<br>
        answer out of him.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.2><b>NAZAROVNA.</b> [Lifting the corner of a cloth covering of SAVVA'S face] Are<br>
        you alive or are you dead, you holy man?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.3><b>SAVVA.</b> Why should I be dead? I'm alive, mother! [Raises himself on his<br>
        elbow] Cover up my feet, there's a saint! That's it. A bit more on the<br>
        right one. That's it, mother. God be good to us.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.4><b>NAZAROVNA.</b> [Wrapping up SAVVA'S feet] Sleep, little father.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.5><b>SAVVA.</b> What sleep can I have? If only I had the patience to endure this<br>
        pain, mother; sleep's quite another matter. A sinner doesn't deserve to<br>
        be given rest. What's that noise, pilgrim-woman?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.6><b>NAZAROVNA.</b> God is sending a storm. The wind is wailing, and the rain is<br>
        pouring down, pouring down. All down the roof and into the windows like<br>
        dried peas. Do you hear? The windows of heaven are opened... [Thunder]<br>
        Holy, holy, holy...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.7><b>FEDYA.</b> And it roars and thunders, and rages, sad there's no end to it!<br>
        Hoooo... it's like the noise of a forest.... Hoooo.... The wind is<br>
        wailing like a dog.... [Shrinking back] It's cold! My clothes are wet,<br>
        it's all coming in through the open door... you might put me through a<br>
        wringer.... [Plays softly] My concertina's damp, and so there's no music<br>
        for you, my Orthodox brethren, or else I'd give you such a concert, my<br>
        word!&mdash;Something marvellous! You can have a quadrille, or a polka,<br>
        if you like, or some Russian dance for two.... I can do them all. In the<br>
        town, where I was an attendant at the Grand Hotel, I couldn't make any<br>
        money, but I did wonders on my concertina. And, I can play the guitar.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.8><b>A VOICE FROM THE CORNER.</b> A silly speech from a silly fool.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.9><b>FEDYA.</b> I can hear another of them. [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.10><b>NAZAROVNA.</b> [To SAVVA] If you'd only lie where it was warm now, old man,<br>
        and warm your feet. [Pause.] Old man! Man of God! [Shakes SAVVA] Are you<br>
        going to die?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.11><b>FEDYA.</b> You ought to drink a little vodka, grandfather. Drink, and it'll<br>
        burn, burn in your stomach, and warm up your heart. Drink, do!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.12><b>NAZAROVNA.</b> Don't swank, young man! Perhaps the old man is giving back<br>
        his soul to God, or repenting for his sins, and you talk like that, and<br>
        play your concertina.... Put it down! You've no shame!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.13><b>FEDYA.</b> And what are you sticking to him for? He can't do anything and<br>
        you... with your old women's talk... He can't say a word in reply, and<br>
        you're glad, and happy because he's listening to your nonsense.... You<br>
        go on sleeping, grandfather; never mind her! Let her talk, don't you<br>
        take any notice of her. A woman's tongue is the devil's broom&mdash;it<br>
        will sweep the good man and the clever man both out of the house. Don't<br>
        you mind.... [Waves his hands] But it's thin you are, brother of mine!<br>
        Terrible! Like a dead skeleton! No life in you! Are you really dying?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.14><b>SAVVA.</b> Why should I die? Save me, O Lord, from dying in vain.... I'll<br>
        suffer a little, and then get up with God's help.... The Mother of God<br>
        won't let me die in a strange land.... I'll die at home.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.15><b>FEDYA.</b> Are you from far off?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.16><b>SAVVA.</b> From Vologda. The town itself.... I live there.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.17><b>FEDYA.</b> And where is this Vologda?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.18><b>TIHON.</b> The other side of Moscow....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.19><b>FEDYA.</b> Well, well, well.... You have come a long way, old man! On foot?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.20><b>SAVVA.</b> On foot, young man. I've been to Tihon of the Don, and I'm going<br>
        to the Holy Hills. [Note: On the Donetz, south-east of Kharkov; a<br>
        monastery containing a miraculous ikon.]... From there, if God wills it,<br>
        to Odessa.... They say you can get to Jerusalem cheap from there, for<br>
        twenty-ones roubles, they say....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.21><b>FEDYA.</b> And have you been to Moscow?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.22><b>SAVVA.</b> Rather! Five times....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.23><b>FEDYA.</b> Is it a good town? [Smokes] Well-standing?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.24><b>Sews.</b> There are many holy places there, young man.... Where there are<br>
        many holy places it's always a good town....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.25><b>BORTSOV.</b> [Goes up to the counter, to TIHON] Once more, please! For the<br>
        sake of Christ, give it to me!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.26><b>FEDYA.</b> The chief thing about a town is that it should be clean. If it's<br>
        dusty, it must be watered; if it's dirty, it must be cleaned. There<br>
        ought to be big houses... a theatre... police... cabs, which... I've<br>
        lived in a town myself, I understand.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.27><b>BORTSOV.</b> Just a little glass. I'll pay you for it later.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.28><b>TIHON.</b> That's enough now.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.29><b>BORTSOV.</b> I ask you! Do be kind to me!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.30><b>TIHON.</b> Get away!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.31><b>BORTSOV.</b> You don't understand me.... Understand me, you fool, if there's<br>
        a drop of brain in your peasant's wooden head, that it isn't I who am<br>
        asking you, but my inside, using the words you understand, that's what's<br>
        asking! My illness is what's asking! Understand!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.32><b>TIHON.</b> We don't understand anything.... Get back!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.33><b>BORTSOV.</b> Because if I don't have a drink at once, just you understand<br>
        this, if I don't satisfy my needs, I may commit some crime. God only<br>
        knows what I might do! In the time you've kept this place, you rascal,<br>
        haven't you seen a lot of drunkards, and haven't you yet got to<br>
        understand what they're like? They're diseased! You can do anything you<br>
        like to them, but you must give them vodka! Well, now, I implore you!<br>
        Please! I humbly ask you! God only knows how humbly!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.34><b>TIHON.</b> You can have the vodka if you pay for it.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.35><b>BORTSOV.</b> Where am I to get the money? I've drunk it all! Down to the<br>
        ground! What can I give you? I've only got this coat, but I can't give<br>
        you that. I've nothing on underneath.... Would you like my cap? [Takes<br>
        it off and gives it to TIHON]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.36><b>TIHON.</b> [Looks it over] Hm.... There are all sorts of caps.... It might<br>
        be a sieve from the holes in it....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.37><b>FEDYA.</b> [Laughs] A gentleman's cap! You've got to take it off in front of<br>
        the mam'selles. How do you do, good-bye! How are you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.38><b>TIHON.</b> [Returns the cap to BORTSOV] I wouldn't give anything for it.<br>
        It's muck.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.39><b>BORTSOV.</b> If you don't like it, then let me owe you for the drink! I'll<br>
        bring in your five copecks on my way back from town. You can take it and<br>
        choke yourself with it then! Choke yourself! I hope it sticks in your<br>
        throat! [Coughs] I hate you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.40><b>TIHON.</b> [Banging the bar-counter with his fist] Why do you keep on like<br>
        that? What a man! What are you here for, you swindler?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.41><b>BORTSOV.</b> I want a drink! It's not I, it's my disease! Understand that!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.42><b>TIHON.</b> Don't you make me lose my temper, or you'll soon find yourself<br>
        outside!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.43><b>BORTSOV.</b> What am I to do? [Retires from the bar-counter] What am I to<br>
        do? [Is thoughtful.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.44><b>EFIMOVNA.</b> It's the devil tormenting you. Don't you mind him, sir. The<br>
        damned one keeps whispering, "Drink! Drink!" And you answer him, "I<br>
        shan't drink! I shan't drink!" He'll go then.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.45><b>FEDYA.</b> It's drumming in his head.... His stomach's leading him on!<br>
        [Laughs] Your houour's a happy man. Lie down and go to sleep! What's the<br>
        use of standing like a scarecrow in the middle of the inn! This isn't an<br>
        orchard!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.46><b>BORTSOV.</b> [Angrily] Shut up! Nobody spoke to you, you donkey.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.47><b>FEDYA.</b> Go on, go on! We've seen the like of you before! There's a lot<br>
        like you tramping the high road! As to being a donkey, you wait till<br>
        I've given you a clout on the ear and you'll howl worse than the wind.<br>
        Donkey yourself! Fool! [Pause] Scum!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.48><b>NAZAROVNA.</b> The old man may be saying a prayer, or giving up his soul to<br>
        God, and here are these unclean ones wrangling with one another and<br>
        saying all sorts of... Have shame on yourselves!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.49><b>FEDYA.</b> Here, you cabbage-stalk, you keep quiet, even if you are in a<br>
        public-house. Just you behave like everybody else.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.50><b>BORTSOV.</b> What am I to do? What will become of me? How can I make him<br>
        understand? What else can I say to him? [To TIHON] The blood's boiling<br>
        in my chest! Uncle Tihon! [Weeps] Uncle Tihon!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.51><b>SAWA.</b> [Groans] I've got shooting-pains in my leg, like bullets of<br>
        fire.... Little mother, pilgrim.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.52><b>EFIMOVNA.</b> What is it, little father?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.53><b>SAVVA.</b> Who's that crying?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.54><b>EFIMOVNA.</b> The gentleman.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.55><b>SAVVA.</b> Ask him to shed a tear for me, that I might die in Vologda.<br>
        Tearful prayers are heard.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.56><b>BORTSOV.</b> I'm not praying, grandfather! These aren't tears! Just juice!<br>
        My soul is crushed; and the juice is running. [Sits by SAVVA] Juice! But<br>
        you wouldn't understand! You, with your darkened brain, wouldn't<br>
        understand. You people are all in the dark!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.57><b>SAVVA.</b> Where will you find those who live in the light?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.58><b>BORTSOV.</b> They do exist, grandfather.... They would understand!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.59><b>SAVVA.</b> Yes, yes, dear friend.... The saints lived in the light.... They<br>
        understood all our griefs.... You needn't even tell them.... and they'll<br>
        understand.... Just by looking at your eyes.... And then you'll have<br>
        such peace, as if you were never in grief at all&mdash;it will all go!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.60><b>FEDYA.</b> And have you ever seen any saints?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.61><b>SAVVA.</b> It has happened, young man.... There are many of all sorts on<br>
        this earth. Sinners, and servants of God.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.62><b>BORTSOV.</b> I don't understand all this.... [Gets up quickly] What's the<br>
        use of talking when you don't understand, and what sort of a brain have<br>
        I now? I've only an instinct, a thirst! [Goes quickly to the counter]<br>
        Tihon, take my coat! Understand? [Tries to take it off] My coat...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.63><b>TIHON.</b> And what is there under your coat? [Looks under it] Your naked<br>
        body? Don't take it off, I shan't have it.... I'm not going to burden my<br>
        soul with a sin.</a><br>
<p>[Enter MERIK.]</p>
<a name=1.1.64><b>BORTSOV.</b> Very well, I'll take the sin on myself! Do you agree?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.65><b>MERIK.</b> [In silence takes of his outer cloak and remains in a sleeveless<br>
        jacket. He carries an axe in his belt] A vagrant may sweat where a bear<br>
        will freeze. I am hot. [Puts his axe on the floor and takes off his<br>
        jacket] You get rid of a pailful of sweat while you drag one leg out of<br>
        the mud. And while you are dragging it out, the other one goes farther<br>
        in.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.66><b>EFIMOVNA.</b> Yes, that's true... is the rain stopping, dear?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.67><b>MERIK.</b> [Glancing at EFIMOVNA] I don't talk to old women. [A pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.68><b>BORTSOV.</b> [To TIHON] I'll take the sin on myself. Do you hear me or don't<br>
        you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.69><b>TIHON.</b> I don't want to hear you, get away!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.70><b>MERIK.</b> It's as dark as if the sky was painted with pitch. You can't see<br>
        your own nose. And the rain beats into your face like a snowstorm!<br>
        [Picks up his clothes and axe.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.71><b>FEDYA.</b> It's a good thing for the likes of us thieves. When the cat's<br>
        away the mice will play.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.72><b>MERIK.</b> Who says that?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.73><b>FEDYA.</b> Look and see... before you forget.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.74><b>MERIN.</b> We'll make a note of it.... [Goes up to TIHON] How do you do, you<br>
        with the large face! Don't you remember me.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.75><b>TIHON.</b> If I'm to remember every one of you drunkards that walks the high<br>
        road, I reckon I'd need ten holes in my forehead.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.76><b>MERIK.</b> Just look at me.... [A pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.77><b>TIHON.</b> Oh, yes; I remember. I knew you by your eyes! [Gives him his<br>
        hand] Andrey Polikarpov?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.78><b>MERIK.</b> I used to be Andrey Polikarpov, but now I am Egor Merik.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.79><b>TIHON.</b> Why's that?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.80><b>MERIK.</b> I call myself after whatever passport God gives me. I've been<br>
        Merik for two months. [Thunder] Rrrr.... Go on thundering, I'm not<br>
        afraid! [Looks round] Any police here?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.81><b>TIHON.</b> What are you talking about, making mountains out of<br>
        mole-hills?... The people here are all right... The police are fast<br>
        asleep in their feather beds now.... [Loudly] Orthodox brothers, mind<br>
        your pockets and your clothes, or you'll have to regret it. The man's a<br>
        rascal! He'll rob you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.82><b>MERIK.</b> They can look out for their money, but as to their clothes&mdash;I<br>
        shan't touch them. I've nowhere to take them.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.83><b>TIHON.</b> Where's the devil taking you to?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.84><b>MERIK.</b> To Kuban.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.85><b>TIHON.</b> My word!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.86><b>FEDYA.</b> To Kuban? Really? [Sitting up] It's a fine place. You wouldn't<br>
        see such a country, brother, if you were to fall asleep and dream for<br>
        three years. They say the birds there, and the beasts are&mdash;my God!<br>
        The grass grows all the year round, the people are good, and they've so<br>
        much land they don't know what to do with it! The authorities, they<br>
        say... a soldier was telling me the other day... give a hundred<br>
        dessiatins ahead. There's happiness, God strike me!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.87><b>MERIK.</b> Happiness.... Happiness goes behind you.... You don't see it.<br>
        It's as near as your elbow is, but you can't bite it. It's all silly....<br>
        [Looking round at the benches and the people] Like a lot of<br>
        prisoners.... A poor lot.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.88><b>EFIMOVNA.</b> [To MERIK] What great, angry, eyes! There's an enemy in you,<br>
        young man.... Don't you look at us!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.89><b>MERIK.</b> Yes, you're a poor lot here.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.90><b>EFIMOVNA.</b> Turn away! [Nudges SAVVA] Savva, darling, a wicked man is<br>
        looking at us. He'll do us harm, dear. [To MERIK] Turn away, I tell you,<br>
        you snake!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.91><b>SAVVA.</b> He won't touch us, mother, he won't touch us.... God won't let<br>
        him.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.92><b>MERIK.</b> All right, Orthodox brothers! [Shrugs his shoulders] Be quiet!<br>
        You aren't asleep, you bandy-legged fools! Why don't you say something?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.93><b>EFIMOVNA.</b> Take your great eyes away! Take away that devil's own pride!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.94><b>MERIK.</b> Be quiet, you crooked old woman! I didn't come with the devil's<br>
        pride, but with kind words, wishing to honour your bitter lot! You're<br>
        huddled together like flies because of the cold&mdash;I'd be sorry for<br>
        you, speak kindly to you, pity your poverty, and here you go grumbling<br>
        away! [Goes up to FEDYA] Where are you from?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.95><b>FEDYA.</b> I live in these parts. I work at the Khamonyevsky brickworks.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.96><b>MERIK.</b> Get up.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.97><b>FEDYA.</b> [Raising himself] Well?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.98><b>MERIK.</b> Get up, right up. I'm going to lie down here.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.99><b>FEDYA.</b> What's that.... It isn't your place, is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.100><b>MERIK.</b> Yes, mine. Go and lie on the ground!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.101><b>FEDYA.</b> You get out of this, you tramp. I'm not afraid of you.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.102><b>MERIK.</b> You're very quick with your tongue.... Get up, and don't talk<br>
        about it! You'll be sorry for it, you silly.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.103><b>TIHON.</b> [To FEDYA] Don't contradict him, young man. Never mind.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.104><b>FEDYA.</b> What right have you? You stick out your fishy eyes and think I'm<br>
        afraid! [Picks up his belongings and stretches himself out on the<br>
        ground] You devil! [Lies down and covers himself all over.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.105><b>MERIK.</b> [Stretching himself out on the bench] I don't expect you've ever<br>
        seen a devil or you wouldn't call me one. Devils aren't like that. [Lies<br>
        down, putting his axe next to him.] Lie down, little brother axe... let<br>
        me cover you.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.106><b>TIHON.</b> Where did you get the axe from?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.107><b>MERIK.</b> Stole it.... Stole it, and now I've got to fuss over it like a<br>
        child with a new toy; I don't like to throw it away, and I've nowhere to<br>
        put it. Like a beastly wife.... Yes.... [Covering himself over] Devils<br>
        aren't like that, brother.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.108><b>FEDYA.</b> [Uncovering his head] What are they like?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.109><b>MERIK.</b> Like steam, like air.... Just blow into the air. [Blows] They're<br>
        like that, you can't see them.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.110><b>A VOICE FROM THE CORNER.</b> You can see them if you sit under a harrow.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.111><b>MERIK.</b> I've tried, but I didn't see any.... Old women's tales, and silly<br>
        old men's, too.... You won't see a devil or a ghost or a corpse.... Our<br>
        eyes weren't made so that we could see everything.... When I was a boy,<br>
        I used to walk in the woods at night on purpose to see the demon of the<br>
        woods.... I'd shout and shout, and there might be some spirit, I'd call<br>
        for the demon of the woods and not blink my eyes: I'd see all sorts of<br>
        little things moving about, but no demon. I used to go and walk about<br>
        the churchyards at night, I wanted to see the ghosts&mdash;but the women<br>
        lie. I saw all sorts of animals, but anything awful&mdash;not a sign.<br>
        Our eyes weren't...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.112><b>THE VOICE FROM THE CORNER.</b> Never mind, it does happen that you do<br>

        silly notions! You're an ignorant lot of people living in darkness....<br>
        [Lights his pipe] My father was peasant and used to be fond of teaching<br>
        people. One night he stole a sack of apples from the village priest, and<br>
        he brings them along and tells us, "Look, children, mind you don't eat<br>
        any apples before Easter, it's a sin." You're like that.... You don't<br>
        know what a devil is, but you go calling people devils.... Take this<br>
        crooked old woman, for instance. [Points to EFIMOVNA] She sees an enemy<br>
        in me, but is her time, for some woman's nonsense or other, she's given<br>
        her soul to the devil five times.</a><br>

<a name=1.1.124><b>TIHON.</b> Go and tell that to someone else, not to me.... Go and ask the<br>

        before that there weren't any. Oh, Lord, it was bad! You walk a hundred<br>
        versts, and not only isn't there a village; or a house, but you don't<br>
        even see a dry stick. So you sleep on the ground....</a><br>

        [BORTSOV recognizes KUSMA and retires in confusion to a corner of the<br>

<a name=1.1.163><b>MERIK.</b> [To KUSMA] Who is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.164><b>KUSMA.</b> A miserable sufferer. [Paces irritably by the counter] Eh? In an<br>
        inn, my goodness! Tattered! Drunk! I'm upset, brothers... upset.... [To<br>
        MERIK, in an undertone] It's my master... our landlord. Semyon<br>
        Sergeyevitch and Mr. Bortsov.... Have you ever seen such a state? What<br>
        does he look like? Just... it's the drink that brought him to this....<br>
        Give me some more! [Drinks] I come from his village, Bortsovka; you may<br>
        have heard of it, it's 200 versts from here, in the Ergovsky district.<br>
        We used to be his father's serfs.... What a shame!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.165><b>MERIK.</b> Was he rich?</a><br>

        rich and sober.... [To TIHON] Why you yourself used to see him riding,<br>
        as he used to, past this inn, on his way to the town. Such bold and<br>
        noble horses! A carriage on springs, of the best quality! He used to own<br>
        five troikas, brother.... Five years ago, I remember, he cam here<br>
        driving two horses from Mikishinsky, and he paid with a five-rouble<br>
        piece.... I haven't the time, he says, to wait for the change.... There!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.169><b>MERIK.</b> His brain's gone, I suppose.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.170><b>KUSMA.</b> His brain's all right.... It all happened because of his<br>
        cowardice! From too much fat. First of all, children, because of a<br>
        woman.... He fell in love with a woman of the town, and it seemed to him<br>
        that there wasn't any more beautiful thing in the wide world. A fool may<br>
        love as much as a wise man. The girl's people were all right.... But she<br>
        wasn't exactly loose, but just... giddy... always changing her mind!<br>
        Always winking at one! Always laughing and laughing.... No sense at all.<br>
        The gentry like that, they think that's nice, but we moujiks would soon<br>
        chuck her out.... Well, he fell in love, and his luck ran out. He began<br>
        to keep company with her, one thing led to another... they used to go<br>
        out in a boat all night, and play pianos....</a><br>

<a name=1.1.174><b>KUSMA.</b> [In a semitone which gradually becomes his ordinary voice] How<br>
        shouldn't she? He was a man of means.... Of course you'll fall in love<br>
        when the man has a thousand dessiatins and money to burn.... He was a<br>
        solid, dignified, sober gentleman... always the same, like this... give<br>
        me your hand [Takes MERIK'S hand] "How do you do and good-bye, do me the<br>
        favour." Well, I was going one evening past his garden&mdash;and what a<br>
        garden, brother, versts of it&mdash;I was going along quietly, and I<br>
        look and see the two of them sitting on a seat and kissing each other.<br>
        [Imitates the sound] He kisses her once, and the snake gives him back<br>
        two.... He was holding her white, little hand, and she was all fiery and<br>
        kept on getting closer and closer, too.... "I love you," she says. And<br>
        he, like one of the damned, walks about from one place to another and<br>
        brags, the coward, about his happiness.... Gives one man a rouble, and<br>
        two to another.... Gives me money for a horse. Let off everybody's<br>
        debts....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.175><b>BORTSOV.</b> Oh, why tell them all about it? These people haven't any<br>
        sympathy.... It hurts!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.176><b>KUSMA.</b> It's nothing, sir! They asked me! Why shouldn't I tell them? But<br>
        if you are angry I won't... I won't.... What do I care for them....<br>
        [Post-bells are heard.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.177><b>FEDYA.</b> Don't shout; tell us quietly....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.178><b>KUSMA.</b> I'll tell you quietly.... He doesn't want me to, but it can't be<br>
        helped.... But there's nothing more to tell. They got married, that's<br>
        all. There was nothing else. Pour out another drop for Kusma the stony!<br>
        [Drinks] I don't like people getting drunk! Why the time the wedding<br>
        took place, when the gentlefolk sat down to supper afterwards, she went<br>
        off in a carriage... [Whispers] To the town, to her lover, a lawyer....<br>
        Eh? What do you think of her now? Just at the very moment! She would be<br>
        let off lightly if she were killed for it!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.179><b>MERIK.</b> [Thoughtfully] Well... what happened then?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.180><b>KUSMA.</b> He went mad.... As you see, he started with a fly, as they say,<br>
        and now it's grown to a bumble-bee. It was a fly then, and now&mdash;it's<br>
        a bumble-bee.... And he still loves her. Look at him, he loves her! I<br>
        expect he's walking now to the town to get a glimpse of her with one<br>
        eye.... He'll get a glimpse of her, and go back....</a><br>

        brother-in-law's a thief.... The swindler knows which side his bread's<br>
        buttered and won't budge an inch.... So he doesn't pay up.... So our man<br>
        had to pay up the whole thirty thousand. [Sighs] The fool is suffering<br>
        for his folly. His wife's got children now by the lawyer and the<br>

        that he must drink? Take our village elder, for example. His wife plays<br>

<a name=1.1.192><b>BORTSOV.</b> [Comes up to the bar hesitatingly and drinks] That means I now<br>
        owe you for two glasses.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.193><b>TIHON.</b> You don't owe me anything? Just drink and drown your sorrows!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.194><b>FEDYA.</b> Drink mine, too, sir! Oh! [Throws down a five-copeck piece] If<br>
        you drink, you die; if you don't drink, you die. It's good not to drink<br>
        vodka, but by God you're easier when you've got some! Vodka takes grief<br>
        away.... It is hot!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.195><b>BORTSOV.</b> Boo! The heat!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.196><b>MERIK.</b> Dive it here! [Takes the medallion from TIHON and examines her<br>
        portrait] Hm. Ran off after the wedding. What a woman!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.197><b>A VOICE FROM THE CORNER.</b> Pour him out another glass, Tihon. Let him<br>
        drink mine, too.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.198><b>MERIK.</b> [Dashes the medallion to the ground] Curse her! [Goes quickly to<br>
        his place and lies down, face to the wall. General excitement.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.199><b>BORTSOV.</b> Here, what's that? [Picks up the medallion] How dare you, you<br>
        beast? What right have you? [Tearfully] Do you want me to kill you? You<br>
        moujik! You boor!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.200><b>TIHON.</b> Don't be angry, sir.... It isn't glass, it isn't broken.... Have<br>
        another drink and go to sleep. [Pours out] Here I've been listening to<br>
        you all, and when I ought to have locked up long ago. [Goes and looks<br>
        door leading out.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.201><b>BORTSOV.</b> [Drinks] How dare he? The fool! [to MERIK] Do you understand?<br>
        You're a fool, a donkey!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.202><b>SAVVA.</b> Children! If you please! Stop that talking! What's the good of<br>
        making a noise? Let people go to sleep.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.203><b>TIHON.</b> Lie down, lie down... be quiet! [Goes behind the counter and<br>
        locks the till] It's time to sleep.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.204><b>FEDYA.</b> It's time! [Lies down] Pleasant dreams, brothers!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.205><b>MERIK.</b> [Gets up and spreads his short fur and coat the bench] Come on,<br>
        lie down, sir.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.206><b>TIHON.</b> And where will you sleep.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.207><b>MERIK.</b> Oh, anywhere.... The floor will do.... [Spreads a coat on the<br>
        floor] It's all one to me [Puts the axe by him] It would be torture for<br>
        him to sleep on the floor. He's used to silk and down....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.208><b>TIHON.</b> [To BORTSOV] Lie down, your honour! You've looked at that<br>
        portrait long enough. [Puts out a candle] Throw it away!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.209><b>BORTSOV.</b> [Swaying about] Where can I lie down?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.210><b>TIHON.</b> In the tramp's place! Didn't you hear him giving it up to you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.211><b>BORTSOV.</b> [Going up to the vacant place] I'm a bit... drunk... after all<br>
        that.... Is this it?... Do I lie down here? Eh?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.212><b>TIHON.</b> Yes, yes, lie down, don't be afraid. [Stretches himself out on<br>
        the counter.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.213><b>BORTSOV.</b> [Lying down] I'm... drunk.... Everything's going round....<br>
        [Opens the medallion] Haven't you a little candle? [Pause] You're a<br>
        queer little woman Masha.... Looking at me out of the frame and<br>
        laughing.... [Laughs] I'm drunk! And should you laugh at a man because<br>
        he's drunk? You look out, as Schastlivtsev says, and... love the<br>
        drunkard.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.214><b>FEDYA.</b> How the wind howls. It's dreary!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.215><b>BORTSOV.</b> [Laughs] What a woman.... Why do you keep on going round? I<br>
        can't catch you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.216><b>MERIK.</b> He's wandering. Looked too long at the portrait. [Laughs] What a<br>
        business! Educated people go and invent all sorts of machines and<br>
        medicines, but there hasn't yet been a man wise enough to invent a<br>
        medicine against the female sex.... They try to cure every sort of<br>
        disease, and it never occurs to them that more people die of women than<br>
        of disease.... Sly, stingy, cruel, brainless.... The mother-in-law<br>
        torments the bride and the bride makes things square by swindling the<br>
        husband... and there's no end to it....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.217><b>TIHON.</b> The women have ruffled his hair for him, and so he's bristly.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.218><b>MERIK.</b> It isn't only I.... From the beginning of the ages, since the<br>
        world has been in existence, people have complained.... It's not for<br>
        nothing that in the songs and stories, the devil and the woman are put<br>
        side by side.... Not for nothing! It's half true, at any rate... [Pause]<br>
        Here's the gentleman playing the fool, but I had more sense, didn't I,<br>
        when I left my father and mother, and became a tramp?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.219><b>FEDYA.</b> Because of women?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.220><b>MERIK.</b> Just like the gentleman... I walked about like one of the damned,<br>
        bewitched, blessing my stars... on fire day and night, until at last my<br>
        eyes were opened... It wasn't love, but just a fraud....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.221><b>FEDYA.</b> What did you do to her?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.222><b>MERIK.</b> Never you mind.... [Pause] Do you think I killed her?... I<br>
        wouldn't do it.... If you kill, you are sorry for it.... She can live<br>
        and be happy! If only I'd never set eyes on you, or if I could only<br>
        forget you, you viper's brood! [A knocking at the door.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.223><b>TIHON.</b> Whom have the devils brought.... Who's there? [Knocking] Who<br>
        knocks? [Gets up and goes to the door] Who knocks? Go away, we've locked<br>
        up!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.224><b>A VOICE.</b> Please let me in, Tihon. The carriage-spring's broken! Be a<br>
        father to me and help me! If I only had a little string to tie it round<br>
        with, we'd get there somehow or other.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.225><b>TIHON.</b> Who are you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.226><b>THE VOICE.</b> My lady is going to Varsonofyev from the town.... It's only<br>
        five versts farther on.... Do be a good man and help!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.227><b>TIHON.</b> Go and tell the lady that if she pays ten roubles she can have<br>
        her string and we'll mend the spring.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.228><b>THE VOICE.</b> Have you gone mad, or what? Ten roubles! You mad dog!<br>
        Profiting by our misfortunes!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.229><b>TIHON.</b> Just as you like.... You needn't if you don't want to.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.230><b>THE VOICE.</b> Very well, wait a bit. [Pause] She says, all right.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.231><b>TIHON.</b> Pleased to hear it!</a><br>
<p>[Opens door. The COACHMAN enters.]</p>
<a name=1.1.232><b>COACHMAN.</b> Good evening, Orthodox people! Well, give me the string!<br>
        Quick! Who'll go and help us, children? There'll be something left over<br>
        for your trouble!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.233><b>TIHON.</b> There won't be anything left over.... Let them sleep, the two of<br>
        us can manage.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.234><b>COACHMAN.</b> Foo, I am tired! It's cold, and there's not a dry spot in all<br>
        the mud.... Another thing, dear.... Have you got a little room in here<br>
        for the lady to warm herself in? The carriage is all on one side, she<br>
        can't stay in it....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.235><b>TIHON.</b> What does she want a room for? She can warm herself in here, if<br>
        she's cold.... We'll find a place [Clears a space next to BORTSOV] Get<br>
        up, get up! Just lie on the floor for an hour, and let the lady get<br>
        warm. [To BORTSOV] Get up, your honour! Sit up! [BORTSOV sits up] Here's<br>
        a place for you. [Exit COACHMAN.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.236><b>FEDYA.</b> Here's a visitor for you, the devil's brought her! Now there'll<br>
        be no sleep before daylight.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.237><b>TIHON.</b> I'm sorry I didn't ask for fifteen.... She'd have given them....<br>
        [Stands expectantly before the door] You're a delicate sort of people, I<br>
        must say. [Enter MARIA EGOROVNA, followed by the COACHMAN. TIHON bows.]<br>
        Please, your highness! Our room is very humble, full of blackbeetles!<br>
        But don't disdain it!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.238><b>MARIA EGOROVNA.</b> I can't see anything.... Which way do I go?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.239><b>TIHON.</b> This way, your highness! [Leads her to the place next to BORTSOV]<br>
        This way, please. [Blows on the place] I haven't any separate rooms,<br>
        excuse me, but don't you be afraid, madam, the people here are good and<br>
        quiet....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.240><b>MARIA EGOROVNA.</b> [Sits next to BORTSOV] How awfully stuffy! Open the<br>
        door, at any rate!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.241><b>TIHON.</b> Yes, madam. [Runs and opens the door wide.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.242><b>MARIA.</b> We're freezing, and you open the door! [Gets up and slams it] Who<br>
        are you to be giving orders? [Lies down]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.243><b>TIHON.</b> Excuse me, your highness, but we've a little fool here... a bit<br>
        cracked.... But don't you be frightened, he won't do you any harm....<br>
        Only you must excuse me, madam, I can't do this for ten roubles.... Make<br>
        it fifteen.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.244><b>MARIA EGOROVNA.</b> Very well, only be quick.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.245><b>TIHON.</b> This minute... this very instant. [Drags some string out from<br>
        under the counter] This minute. [A pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.246><b>BORTSOV.</b> [Looking at MARIA EGOROVNA] Marie... Masha...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.247><b>MARIA EGOROVNA.</b> [Looks at BORTSOV] What's this?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.248><b>BORTSOV.</b> Marie... is it you? Where do you come from? [MARIA EGOROVNA<br>
        recognizes BORTSOV, screams and runs off into the centre of the floor.<br>
        BORTSOV follows] Marie, it is I... I [Laughs loudly] My wife! Marie!<br>
        Where am I? People, a light!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.249><b>MARIA EGOROVNA.</b> Get away from me! You lie, it isn't you! It can't be!<br>
        [Covers her face with her hands] It's a lie, it's all nonsense!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.250><b>BORTSOV.</b> Her voice, her movements.... Marie, it is I! I'll stop in a<br>
        moment.... I was drunk.... My head's going round.... My God! Stop,<br>
        stop.... I can't understand anything. [Yells] My wife! [Falls at her<br>
        feet and sobs. A group collects around the husband and wife.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.251><b>MARIA EGOROVNA.</b> Stand back! [To the COACHMAN] Denis, let's go! I can't<br>
        stop here any longer!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.252><b>MERIK.</b> [Jumps up and looks her steadily in the face] The portrait!<br>
        [Grasps her hand] It is she! Eh, people, she's the gentleman's wife!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.253><b>MARIA EGOROVNA.</b> Get away, fellow! [Tries to tear her hand away from him]<br>
        Denis, why do you stand there staring? [DENIS and TIHON run up to her<br>
        and get hold of MERIK'S arms] This thieves' kitchen! Let go my hand! I'm<br>
        not afraid!... Get away from me!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.254><b>MERIK.</b> [Note: Throughout this speech, in the original, Merik uses the<br>
        familiar second person singular.] Wait a bit, and I'll let go.... Just<br>
        let me say one word to you.... One word, so that you may understand....<br>
        Just wait.... [Turns to TIHON and DENIS] Get away, you rogues, let go! I<br>
        shan't let you go till I've had my say! Stop... one moment. [Strikes his<br>
        forehead with his fist] No, God hasn't given me the wisdom! I can't<br>
        think of the word for you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.255><b>MARIA EGOROVNA.</b> [Tears away her hand] Get away! Drunkards... let's go,<br>
        Denis!</a><br>
<p>[She tries to go out, but MERIK blocks the door.]</p>
<a name=1.1.256><b>MERIK.</b> Just throw a glance at him, with only one eye if you like! Or say<br>
        only just one kind little word to him! God's own sake!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.257><b>MARIA EGOROVNA.</b> Take away this... fool.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.258><b>MERIK.</b> Then the devil take you, you accursed woman!</a><br>
<p>[He swings his axe. General confusion. Everybody jumps up noisily and<br>
        with cries of horror. SAVVA stands between MERIK and MARIA EGOROVNA....<br>
        DENIS forces MERIK to one side and carries out his mistress. After this<br>
        all stand as if turned to stone. A prolonged pause. BORTSOV suddenly<br>
        waves his hands in the air.]</p>
<a name=1.1.259><b>BORTSOV.</b> Marie... where are you, Marie!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.260><b>NAZAROVNA.</b> My God, my God! You've torn up my your murderers! What an<br>
        accursed night!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.261><b>MERIK.</b> [Lowering his hand; he still holds the axe] Did I kill her or no?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.262><b>TIHON.</b> Thank God, your head is safe....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.263><b>MERIK.</b> Then I didn't kill her.... [Totters to his bed] Fate hasn't sent<br>
        me to my death because of a stolen axe.... [Falls down and sobs] Woe!<br>
        Woe is me! Have pity on me, Orthodox people!</a><br>
<p>Curtain.</p>
