<h2>THE THREE SISTERS</h2>
<h3>ACT I</h3>
<p>[In PROSOROV'S house. A sitting-room with pillars; behind is seen a<br>
        large dining-room. It is midday, the sun is shining brightly outside. In<br>
        the dining-room the table is being laid for lunch.]</p>
<p>[OLGA, in the regulation blue dress of a teacher at a girl's high<br>
        school, is walking about correcting exercise books; MASHA, in a black<br>
        dress, with a hat on her knees, sits and reads a book; IRINA, in white,<br>
        stands about, with a thoughtful expression.]</p>
<a name=1.1.1><b>OLGA.</b> It's just a year since father died last May the fifth, on your<br>
        name-day, Irina. It was very cold then, and snowing. I thought I would<br>
        never survive it, and you were in a dead faint. And now a year has gone<br>
        by and we are already thinking about it without pain, and you are<br>
        wearing a white dress and your face is happy. [Clock strikes twelve] And<br>
        the clock struck just the same way then. [Pause] I remember that there<br>
        was music at the funeral, and they fired a volley in the cemetery. He<br>
        was a general in command of a brigade but there were few people present.<br>
        Of course, it was raining then, raining hard, and snowing.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.2><b>IRINA.</b> Why think about it!</a><br>
<p>[BARON TUZENBACH, CHEBUTIKIN and SOLENI appear by the table in the<br>
        dining-room, behind the pillars.]</p>
<a name=1.1.3><b>OLGA.</b> It's so warm to-day that we can keep the windows open, though the<br>
        birches are not yet in flower. Father was put in command of a brigade,<br>
        and he rode out of Moscow with us eleven years ago. I remember perfectly<br>
        that it was early in May and that everything in Moscow was flowering<br>
        then. It was warm too, everything was bathed in sunshine. Eleven years<br>
        have gone, and I remember everything as if we rode out only yesterday.<br>
        Oh, God! When I awoke this morning and saw all the light and the spring,<br>
        joy entered my heart, and I longed passionately to go home.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.4><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Will you take a bet on it?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.5><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Oh, nonsense.</a><br>
<p>[MASHA, lost in a reverie over her book, whistles softly.]</p>
<a name=1.1.6><b>OLGA.</b> Don't whistle, Masha. How can you! [Pause] I'm always having<br>
        headaches from having to go to the High School every day and then teach<br>
        till evening. Strange thoughts come to me, as if I were already an old<br>
        woman. And really, during these four years that I have been working<br>
        here, I have been feeling as if every day my strength and youth have<br>
        been squeezed out of me, drop by drop. And only one desire grows and<br>
        gains in strength...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.7><b>IRINA.</b> To go away to Moscow. To sell the house, drop everything here,<br>
        and go to Moscow...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.8><b>OLGA.</b> Yes! To Moscow, and as soon as possible.</a><br>
<p>[CHEBUTIKIN and TUZENBACH laugh.]</p>
<a name=1.1.9><b>IRINA.</b> I expect Andrey will become a professor, but still, he won't want<br>
        to live here. Only poor Masha must go on living here.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.10><b>OLGA.</b> Masha can come to Moscow every year, for the whole summer.</a><br>
<p>[MASHA is whistling gently.]</p>
<a name=1.1.11><b>IRINA.</b> Everything will be arranged, please God. [Looks out of the<br>
        window] It's nice out to-day. I don't know why I'm so happy: I<br>
        remembered this morning that it was my name-day, and I suddenly felt<br>
        glad and remembered my childhood, when mother was still with us. What<br>
        beautiful thoughts I had, what thoughts!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.12><b>OLGA.</b> You're all radiance to-day, I've never seen you look so lovely.<br>
        And Masha is pretty, too. Andrey wouldn't be bad-looking, if he wasn't<br>
        so stout; it does spoil his appearance. But I've grown old and very<br>
        thin, I suppose it's because I get angry with the girls at school.<br>
        To-day I'm free. I'm at home. I haven't got a headache, and I feel<br>
        younger than I was yesterday. I'm only twenty-eight.... All's well, God<br>
        is everywhere, but it seems to me that if only I were married and could<br>
        stay at home all day, it would be even better. [Pause] I should love my<br>
        husband.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.13><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [To SOLENI] I'm tired of listening to the rot you talk.<br>
        [Entering the sitting-room] I forgot to say that Vershinin, our new<br>
        lieutenant-colonel of artillery, is coming to see us to-day. [Sits down<br>
        to the piano.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.14><b>OLGA.</b> That's good. I'm glad.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.15><b>IRINA.</b> Is he old?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.16><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Oh, no. Forty or forty-five, at the very outside. [Plays<br>
        softly] He seems rather a good sort. He's certainly no fool, only he<br>
        likes to hear himself speak.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.17><b>IRINA.</b> Is he interesting?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.18><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Oh, he's all right, but there's his wife, his mother-in-law,<br>
        and two daughters. This is his second wife. He pays calls and tells<br>
        everybody that he's got a wife and two daughters. He'll tell you so<br>
        here. The wife isn't all there, she does her hair like a flapper and<br>
        gushes extremely. She talks philosophy and tries to commit suicide every<br>
        now and again, apparently in order to annoy her husband. I should have<br>
        left her long ago, but he bears up patiently, and just grumbles.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.19><b>SOLENI.</b> [Enters with CHEBUTIKIN from the dining-room] With one hand I<br>
        can only lift fifty-four pounds, but with both hands I can lift 180, or<br>
        even 200 pounds. From this I conclude that two men are not twice as<br>
        strong as one, but three times, perhaps even more....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.20><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Reads a newspaper as he walks] If your hair is coming<br>
        out... take an ounce of naphthaline and hail a bottle of spirit...<br>
        dissolve and use daily.... [Makes a note in his pocket diary] When found<br>
        make a note of! Not that I want it though.... [Crosses it out] It<br>
        doesn't matter.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.21><b>IRINA.</b> Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.22><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> What does my own little girl want?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.23><b>IRINA.</b> Ivan Romanovitch, dear Ivan Romanovitch! I feel as if I were<br>
        sailing under the broad blue sky with great white birds around me. Why<br>
        is that? Why?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.24><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Kisses her hands, tenderly] My white bird....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.25><b>IRINA.</b> When I woke up to-day and got up and dressed myself, I suddenly<br>
        began to feel as if everything in this life was open to me, and that I<br>
        knew how I must live. Dear Ivan Romanovitch, I know everything. A man<br>
        must work, toil in the sweat of his brow, whoever he may be, for that is<br>
        the meaning and object of his life, his happiness, his enthusiasm. How<br>
        fine it is to be a workman who gets up at daybreak and breaks stones in<br>
        the street, or a shepherd, or a schoolmaster, who teaches children, or<br>
        an engine-driver on the railway.... My God, let alone a man, it's better<br>
        to be an ox, or just a horse, so long as it can work, than a young woman<br>
        who wakes up at twelve o'clock, has her coffee in bed, and then spends<br>
        two hours dressing.... Oh it's awful! Sometimes when it's hot, your<br>
        thirst can be just as tiresome as my need for work. And if I don't get<br>
        up early in future and work, Ivan Romanovitch, then you may refuse me<br>
        your friendship.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.26><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Tenderly] I'll refuse, I'll refuse....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.27><b>OLGA.</b> Father used to make us get up at seven. Now Irina wakes at seven<br>
        and lies and meditates about something till nine at least. And she looks<br>
        so serious! [Laughs.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.28><b>IRINA.</b> You're so used to seeing me as a little girl that it seems queer<br>
        to you when my face is serious. I'm twenty!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.29><b>TUZENBACH.</b> How well I can understand that craving for work, oh God! I've<br>
        never worked once in my life. I was born in Petersburg, a chilly, lazy<br>
        place, in a family which never knew what work or worry meant. I remember<br>
        that when I used to come home from my regiment, a footman used to have<br>
        to pull off my boots while I fidgeted and my mother looked on in<br>
        adoration and wondered why other people didn't see me in the same light.<br>
        They shielded me from work; but only just in time! A new age is dawning,<br>
        the people are marching on us all, a powerful, health-giving storm is<br>
        gathering, it is drawing near, soon it will be upon us and it will drive<br>
        away laziness, indifference, the prejudice against labour, and rotten<br>
        dullness from our society. I shall work, and in twenty-five or thirty<br>
        years, every man will have to work. Every one!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.30><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> I shan't work.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.31><b>TUZENBACH.</b> You don't matter.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.32><b>SOLENI.</b> In twenty-five years' time, we shall all be dead, thank the<br>
        Lord. In two or three years' time apoplexy will carry you off, or else<br>
        I'll blow your brains out, my pet. [Takes a scent-bottle out of his<br>
        pocket and sprinkles his chest and hands.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.33><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Laughs] It's quite true, I never have worked. After I came<br>
        down from the university I never stirred a finger or opened a book, I<br>
        just read the papers.... [Takes another newspaper out of his pocket]<br>
        Here we are.... I've learnt from the papers that there used to be one,<br>
        Dobrolubov [Note: Dobroluboy (1836-81), in spite of the shortness of his<br>
        career, established himself as one of the classic literary critics of<br>
        Russia], for instance, but what he wrote&mdash;I don't know... God only<br>
        knows.... [Somebody is heard tapping on the floor from below] There....<br>
        They're calling me downstairs, somebody's come to see me. I'll be back<br>
        in a minute... won't be long.... [Exit hurriedly, scratching his beard.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.34><b>IRINA.</b> He's up to something.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.35><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Yes, he looked so pleased as he went out that I'm pretty<br>
        certain he'll bring you a present in a moment.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.36><b>IRINA.</b> How unpleasant!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.37><b>OLGA.</b> Yes, it's awful. He's always doing silly things.</a><br>
<p>[Gets up and sings softly.]</p>
<a name=1.1.38><b>OLGA.</b> You're not very bright to-day, Masha. [MASHA sings, putting on her<br>
        hat] Where are you off to?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.39><b>MASHA.</b> Home.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.40><b>IRINA.</b> That's odd....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.41><b>TUZENBACH.</b> On a name-day, too!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.42><b>MASHA.</b> It doesn't matter. I'll come in the evening. Good-bye, dear.<br>
        [Kisses MASHA] Many happy returns, though I've said it before. In the<br>
        old days when father was alive, every time we had a name-day, thirty or<br>
        forty officers used to come, and there was lots of noise and fun, and<br>
        to-day there's only a man and a half, and it's as quiet as a desert...<br>
        I'm off... I've got the hump to-day, and am not at all cheerful, so<br>
        don't you mind me. [Laughs through her tears] We'll have a talk later<br>
        on, but good-bye for the present, my dear; I'll go somewhere.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.43><b>IRINA.</b> [Displeased] You are queer....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.44><b>OLGA.</b> [Crying] I understand you, Masha.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.45><b>SOLENI.</b> When a man talks philosophy, well, it is philosophy or at any<br>
        rate sophistry; but when a woman, or two women, talk philosophy&mdash;it's<br>
        all my eye.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.46><b>MASHA.</b> What do you mean by that, you very awful man?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.47><b>SOLENI.</b> Oh, nothing. You came down on me before I could say... help!<br>
        [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.48><b>MASHA.</b> [Angrily, to OLGA] Don't cry!</a><br>
<p>[Enter ANFISA and FERAPONT with a cake.]</p>
<a name=1.1.49><b>ANFISA.</b> This way, my dear. Come in, your feet are clean. [To IRINA] From<br>
        the District Council, from Mihail Ivanitch Protopopov... a cake.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.50><b>IRINA.</b> Thank you. Please thank him. [Takes the cake.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.51><b>FERAPONT.</b> What?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.52><b>IRINA.</b> [Louder] Please thank him.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.53><b>OLGA.</b> Give him a pie, nurse. Ferapont, go, she'll give you a pie.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.54><b>FERAPONT.</b> What?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.55><b>ANFISA.</b> Come on, gran'fer, Ferapont Spiridonitch. Come on. [Exeunt.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.56><b>MASHA.</b> I don't like this Mihail Potapitch or Ivanitch, Protopopov. We<br>
        oughtn't to invite him here.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.57><b>IRINA.</b> I never asked him.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.58><b>MASHA.</b> That's all right.</a><br>
<p>[Enter CHEBUTIKIN followed by a soldier with a silver samovar; there is<br>
        a rumble of dissatisfied surprise.]</p>
<a name=1.1.59><b>OLGA.</b> [Covers her face with her hands] A samovar! That's awful! [Exit<br>
        into the dining-room, to the table.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.60><b>IRINA.</b> My dear Ivan Romanovitch, what are you doing!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.61><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Laughs] I told you so!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.62><b>MASHA.</b> Ivan Romanovitch, you are simply shameless!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.63><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> My dear good girl, you are the only thing, and the dearest<br>
        thing I have in the world. I'll soon be sixty. I'm an old man, a lonely<br>
        worthless old man. The only good thing in me is my love for you, and if<br>
        it hadn't been for that, I would have been dead long ago.... [To IRINA]<br>
        My dear little girl, I've known you since the day of your birth, I've<br>
        carried you in my arms... I loved your dead mother....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.64><b>MASHA.</b> But your presents are so expensive!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.65><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Angrily, through his tears] Expensive presents.... You<br>
        really, are!... [To the orderly] Take the samovar in there.... [Teasing]<br>
        Expensive presents!</a><br>
<p>[The orderly goes into the dining-room with the samovar.]</p>
<a name=1.1.66><b>ANFISA.</b> [Enters and crosses stage] My dear, there's a strange Colonel<br>
        come! He's taken off his coat already. Children, he's coming here. Irina<br>
        darling, you'll be a nice and polite little girl, won't you.... Should<br>
        have lunched a long time ago.... Oh, Lord.... [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.67><b>TUZENBACH.</b> It must be Vershinin. [Enter VERSHININ] Lieutenant-Colonel<br>
        Vershinin!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.68><b>VERSHININ.</b> [To MASHA and IRINA] I have the honour to introduce myself,<br>
        my name is Vershinin. I am very glad indeed to be able to come at last.<br>
        How you've grown! Oh! oh!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.69><b>IRINA.</b> Please sit down. We're very glad you've come.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.70><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Gaily] I am glad, very glad! But there are three sisters,<br>
        surely. I remember&mdash;three little girls. I forget your faces, but<br>
        your father, Colonel Prosorov, used to have three little girls, I<br>
        remember that perfectly, I saw them with my own eyes. How time does fly!<br>
        Oh, dear, how it flies!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.71><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Alexander Ignateyevitch comes from Moscow.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.72><b>IRINA.</b> From Moscow? Are you from Moscow?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.73><b>VERSHININ.</b> Yes, that's so. Your father used to be in charge of a battery<br>
        there, and I was an officer in the same brigade. [To MASHA] I seem to<br>
        remember your face a little.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.74><b>MASHA.</b> I don't remember you.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.75><b>IRINA.</b> Olga! Olga! [Shouts into the dining-room] Olga! Come along! [OLGA<br>
        enters from the dining-room] Lieutenant Colonel Vershinin comes from<br>
        Moscow, as it happens.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.76><b>VERSHININ.</b> I take it that you are Olga Sergeyevna, the eldest, and that<br>
        you are Maria... and you are Irina, the youngest....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.77><b>OLGA.</b> So you come from Moscow?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.78><b>VERSHININ.</b> Yes. I went to school in Moscow and began my service there; I<br>
        was there for a long time until at last I got my battery and moved over<br>
        here, as you see. I don't really remember you, I only remember that<br>
        there used to be three sisters. I remember your father well; I have only<br>
        to shut my eyes to see him as he was. I used to come to your house in<br>
        Moscow....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.79><b>OLGA.</b> I used to think I remembered everybody, but...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.80><b>VERSHININ.</b> My name is Alexander Ignateyevitch.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.81><b>IRINA.</b> Alexander Ignateyevitch, you've come from Moscow. That is really<br>
        quite a surprise!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.82><b>OLGA.</b> We are going to live there, you see.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.83><b>IRINA.</b> We think we may be there this autumn. It's our native town, we<br>
        were born there. In Old Basmanni Road.... [They both laugh for joy.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.84><b>MASHA.</b> We've unexpectedly met a fellow countryman. [Briskly] I remember:<br>
        Do you remember, Olga, they used to speak at home of a "lovelorn Major."<br>
        You were only a Lieutenant then, and in love with somebody, but for some<br>
        reason they always called you a Major for fun.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.85><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Laughs] That's it... the lovelorn Major, that's got it!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.86><b>MASHA.</b> You only wore moustaches then. You have grown older! [Through her<br>
        tears] You have grown older!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.87><b>VERSHININ.</b> Yes, when they used to call me the lovelorn Major, I was<br>
        young and in love. I've grown out of both now.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.88><b>OLGA.</b> But you haven't a single white hair yet. You're older, but you're<br>
        not yet old.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.89><b>VERSHININ.</b> I'm forty-two, anyway. Have you been away from Moscow long?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.90><b>IRINA.</b> Eleven years. What are you crying for, Masha, you little fool....<br>
        [Crying] And I'm crying too.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.91><b>MASHA.</b> It's all right. And where did you live?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.92><b>VERSHININ.</b> Old Basmanni Road.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.93><b>OLGA.</b> Same as we.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.94><b>VERSHININ.</b> Once I used to live in German Street. That was when the Red<br>
        Barracks were my headquarters. There's an ugly bridge in between, where<br>
        the water rushes underneath. One gets melancholy when one is alone<br>
        there. [Pause] Here the river is so wide and fine! It's a splendid<br>
        river!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.95><b>OLGA.</b> Yes, but it's so cold. It's very cold here, and the midges....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.96><b>VERSHININ.</b> What are you saying! Here you've got such a fine healthy<br>
        Russian climate. You've a forest, a river... and birches. Dear, modest<br>
        birches, I like them more than any other tree. It's good to live here.<br>
        Only it's odd that the railway station should be thirteen miles away....<br>
        Nobody knows why.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.97><b>SOLENI.</b> I know why. [All look at him] Because if it was near it wouldn't<br>
        be far off, and if it's far off, it can't be near. [An awkward pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.98><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Funny man.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.99><b>OLGA.</b> Now I know who you are. I remember.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.100><b>VERSHININ.</b> I used to know your mother.</a><br>

<a name=1.1.103><b>OLGA.</b> At the Novo-Devichi Cemetery.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.104><b>MASHA.</b> Do you know, I'm beginning to forget her face. We'll be forgotten<br>
        in just the same way.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.105><b>VERSHININ.</b> Yes, they'll forget us. It's our fate, it can't be helped. A<br>
        time will come when everything that seems serious, significant, or very<br>
        important to us will be forgotten, or considered trivial. [Pause] And<br>
        the curious thing is that we can't possibly find out what will come to<br>
        be regarded as great and important, and what will be feeble, or silly.<br>
        Didn't the discoveries of Copernicus, or Columbus, say, seem unnecessary<br>
        and ludicrous at first, while wasn't it thought that some rubbish<br>
        written by a fool, held all the truth? And it may so happen that our<br>
        present existence, with which we are so satisfied, will in time appear<br>
        strange, inconvenient, stupid, unclean, perhaps even sinful....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.106><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Who knows? But on the other hand, they may call our life<br>
        noble and honour its memory. We've abolished torture and capital<br>
        punishment, we live in security, but how much suffering there is still!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.107><b>SOLENI.</b> [In a feeble voice] There, there.... The Baron will go without<br>
        his dinner if you only let him talk philosophy.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.108><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Vassili Vassilevitch, kindly leave me alone. [Changes his<br>
        chair] You're very dull, you know.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.109><b>SOLENI.</b> [Feebly] There, there, there.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.110><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [To VERSHININ] The sufferings we see to-day&mdash;there are<br>
        so many of them!&mdash;still indicate a certain moral improvement in<br>
        society.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.111><b>VERSHININ.</b> Yes, yes, of course.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.112><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> You said just now, Baron, that they may call our life noble;<br>
        but we are very petty.... [Stands up] See how little I am. [Violin<br>
        played behind.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.113><b>MASHA.</b> That's Andrey playing&mdash;our brother.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.114><b>IRINA.</b> He's the learned member of the family. I expect he will be a<br>
        professor some day. Father was a soldier, but his son chose an academic<br>
        career for himself.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.115><b>MASHA.</b> That was father's wish.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.116><b>OLGA.</b> We ragged him to-day. We think he's a little in love.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.117><b>IRINA.</b> To a local lady. She will probably come here to-day.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.118><b>MASHA.</b> You should see the way she dresses! Quite prettily, quite<br>
        fashionably too, but so badly! Some queer bright yellow skirt with a<br>
        wretched little fringe and a red bodice. And such a complexion! Andrey<br>
        isn't in love. After all he has taste, he's simply making fun of us. I<br>
        heard yesterday that she was going to marry Protopopov, the chairman of<br>
        the Local Council. That would do her nicely.... [At the side door]<br>
        Andrey, come here! Just for a minute, dear! [Enter ANDREY.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.119><b>OLGA.</b> My brother, Andrey Sergeyevitch.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.120><b>VERSHININ.</b> My name is Vershinin.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.121><b>ANDREY.</b> Mine is Prosorov. [Wipes his perspiring hands] You've come to<br>
        take charge of the battery?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.122><b>OLGA.</b> Just think, Alexander Ignateyevitch comes from Moscow.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.123><b>ANDREY.</b> That's all right. Now my little sisters won't give you any rest.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.124><b>VERSHININ.</b> I've already managed to bore your sisters.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.125><b>IRINA.</b> Just look what a nice little photograph frame Andrey gave me<br>
        to-day. [Shows it] He made it himself.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.126><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Looks at the frame and does not know what to say] Yes....<br>
        It's a thing that...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.127><b>IRINA.</b> And he made that frame there, on the piano as well. [Andrey waves<br>
        his hand and walks away.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.128><b>OLGA.</b> He's got a degree, and plays the violin, and cuts all sorts of<br>
        things out of wood, and is really a domestic Admirable Crichton. Don't<br>
        go away, Andrey! He's got into a habit of always going away. Come here!</a><br>
<p>[MASHA and IRINA take his arms and laughingly lead him back.]</p>
<a name=1.1.129><b>MASHA.</b> Come on, come on!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.130><b>ANDREY.</b> Please leave me alone.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.131><b>MASHA.</b> You are funny. Alexander Ignateyevitch used to be called the<br>
        lovelorn Major, but he never minded.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.132><b>VERSHININ.</b> Not the least.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.133><b>MASHA.</b> I'd like to call you the lovelorn fiddler!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.134><b>IRINA.</b> Or the lovelorn professor!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.135><b>OLGA.</b> He's in love! little Andrey is in love!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.136><b>IRINA.</b> [Applauds] Bravo, Bravo! Encore! Little Andrey is in love.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.137><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Goes up behind ANDREY and takes him round the waist with<br>
        both arms] Nature only brought us into the world that we should love!<br>
        [Roars with laughter, then sits down and reads a newspaper which he<br>
        takes out of his pocket.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.138><b>ANDREY.</b> That's enough, quite enough.... [Wipes his face] I couldn't<br>
        sleep all night and now I can't quite find my feet, so to speak. I read<br>
        until four o'clock, then tried to sleep, but nothing happened. I thought<br>
        about one thing and another, and then it dawned and the sun crawled into<br>
        my bedroom. This summer, while I'm here, I want to translate a book from<br>
        the English....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.139><b>VERSHININ.</b> Do you read English?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.140><b>ANDREY.</b> Yes father, rest his soul, educated us almost violently. It may<br>
        seem funny and silly, but it's nevertheless true, that after his death I<br>
        began to fill out and get rounder, as if my body had had some great<br>
        pressure taken off it. Thanks to father, my sisters and I know French,<br>
        German, and English, and Irina knows Italian as well. But we paid dearly<br>
        for it all!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.141><b>MASHA.</b> A knowledge of three languages is an unnecessary luxury in this<br>
        town. It isn't even a luxury but a sort of useless extra, like a sixth<br>
        finger. We know a lot too much.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.142><b>VERSHININ.</b> Well, I say! [Laughs] You know a lot too much! I don't think<br>
        there can really be a town so dull and stupid as to have no place for a<br>
        clever, cultured person. Let us suppose even that among the hundred<br>
        thousand inhabitants of this backward and uneducated town, there are<br>
        only three persons like yourself. It stands to reason that you won't be<br>
        able to conquer that dark mob around you; little by little as you grow<br>
        older you will be bound to give way and lose yourselves in this crowd of<br>
        a hundred thousand human beings; their life will suck you up in itself,<br>
        but still, you won't disappear having influenced nobody; later on,<br>
        others like you will come, perhaps six of them, then twelve, and so on,<br>
        until at last your sort will be in the majority. In two or three hundred<br>
        years' time life on this earth will be unimaginably beautiful and<br>
        wonderful. Mankind needs such a life, and if it is not ours to-day then<br>
        we must look ahead for it, wait, think, prepare for it. We must see and<br>
        know more than our fathers and grandfathers saw and knew. [Laughs] And<br>
        you complain that you know too much.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.143><b>MASHA.</b> [Takes off her hat] I'll stay to lunch.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.144><b>IRINA.</b> [Sighs] Yes, all that ought to be written down.</a><br>
<p>[ANDREY has gone out quietly.]</p>
<a name=1.1.145><b>TUZENBACH.</b> You say that many years later on, life on this earth will be<br>
        beautiful and wonderful. That's true. But to share in it now, even<br>
        though at a distance, we must prepare by work....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.146><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Gets up] Yes. What a lot of flowers you have. [Looks round]<br>
        It's a beautiful flat. I envy you! I've spent my whole life in rooms<br>
        with two chairs, one sofa, and fires which always smoke. I've never had<br>
        flowers like these in my life.... [Rubs his hands] Well, well!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.147><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Yes, we must work. You are probably thinking to yourself: the<br>
        German lets himself go. But I assure you I'm a Russian, I can't even<br>
        speak German. My father belonged to the Orthodox Church.... [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.148><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Walks about the stage] I often wonder: suppose we could<br>
        begin life over again, knowing what we were doing? Suppose we could use<br>
        one life, already ended, as a sort of rough draft for another? I think<br>
        that every one of us would try, more than anything else, not to repeat<br>
        himself, at the very least he would rearrange his manner of life, he<br>
        would make sure of rooms like these, with flowers and light... I have a<br>
        wife and two daughters, my wife's health is delicate and so on and so<br>
        on, and if I had to begin life all over again I would not marry.... No,<br>
        no!</a><br>
<p>[Enter KULIGIN in a regulation jacket.]</p>
<a name=1.1.149><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Going up to IRINA] Dear sister, allow me to congratulate you<br>
        on the day sacred to your good angel and to wish you, sincerely and from<br>
        the bottom of my heart, good health and all that one can wish for a girl<br>
        of your years. And then let me offer you this book as a present. [Gives<br>
        it to her] It is the history of our High School during the last fifty<br>
        years, written by myself. The book is worthless, and written because I<br>
        had nothing to do, but read it all the same. Good day, gentlemen! [To<br>
        VERSHININ] My name is Kuligin, I am a master of the local High School.<br>
        [Note: He adds that he is aNadvorny Sovetnik(almost the same as<br>
        a GermanHofrat), an undistinguished civilian title with no<br>
        English equivalent.] [To IRINA] In this book you will find a list of all<br>
        those who have taken the full course at our High School during these<br>
        fifty years.Feci quod potui, faciant meliora potentes. [Kisses<br>

<a name=1.1.150><b>IRINA.</b> But you gave me one of these at Easter.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.151><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Laughs] I couldn't have, surely! You'd better give it back to<br>
        me in that case, or else give it to the Colonel. Take it, Colonel.<br>
        You'll read it some day when you're bored.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.152><b>VERSHININ.</b> Thank you. [Prepares to go] I am extremely happy to have made<br>
        the acquaintance of...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.153><b>OLGA.</b> Must you go? No, not yet?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.154><b>IRINA.</b> You'll stop and have lunch with us. Please do.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.155><b>OLGA.</b> Yes, please!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.156><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Bows] I seem to have dropped in on your name-day. Forgive<br>
        me, I didn't know, and I didn't offer you my congratulations. [Goes with<br>
        OLGA into the dining-room.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.157><b>KULIGIN.</b> To-day is Sunday, the day of rest, so let us rest and rejoice,<br>
        each in a manner compatible with his age and disposition. The carpets<br>
        will have to be taken up for the summer and put away till the winter...<br>
        Persian powder or naphthaline.... The Romans were healthy because they<br>
        knew both how to work and how to rest, they hadmens sana in corpore<br>
        sano. Their life ran along certain recognized patterns. Our director<br>
        says: "The chief thing about each life is its pattern. Whoever loses his<br>
        pattern is lost himself"&mdash;and it's just the same in our daily life.<br>
        [Takes MASHA by the waist, laughing] Masha loves me. My wife loves me.<br>
        And you ought to put the window curtains away with the carpets.... I'm<br>
        feeling awfully pleased with life to-day. Masha, we've got to be at the<br>
        director's at four. They're getting up a walk for the pedagogues and<br>
        their families.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.158><b>MASHA.</b> I shan't go.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.159><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Hurt] My dear Masha, why not?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.160><b>MASHA.</b> I'll tell you later.... [Angrily] All right, I'll go, only please<br>
        stand back.... [Steps away.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.161><b>KULIGIN.</b> And then we're to spend the evening at the director's. In spite<br>
        of his ill-health that man tries, above everything else, to be sociable.<br>
        A splendid, illuminating personality. A wonderful man. After yesterday's<br>
        committee he said to me: "I'm tired, Feodor Ilitch, I'm tired!" [Looks<br>
        at the clock, then at his watch] Your clock is seven minutes fast.<br>
        "Yes," he said, "I'm tired." [Violin played off.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.162><b>OLGA.</b> Let's go and have lunch! There's to be a masterpiece of baking!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.163><b>KULIGIN.</b> Oh my dear Olga, my dear. Yesterday I was working till eleven<br>

<a name=1.1.164><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Puts his paper into his pocket, and combs his beard] A pie?<br>
        Splendid!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.165><b>MASHA.</b> [Severely to CHEBUTIKIN] Only mind; you're not to drink anything<br>
        to-day. Do you hear? It's bad for you.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.166><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Oh, that's all right. I haven't been drunk for two years.<br>
        And it's all the same, anyway!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.167><b>MASHA.</b> You're not to dare to drink, all the same. [Angrily, but so that<br>
        her husband should not hear] Another dull evening at the Director's,<br>
        confound it!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.168><b>TUZENBACH.</b> I shouldn't go if I were you.... It's quite simple.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.169><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Don't go.</a><br>

<p>[Only IRINA and TUZENBACH are now left in the sitting-room.]</p>
<a name=1.1.177><b>IRINA.</b> Masha's out of sorts to-day. She married when she was eighteen,<br>

<a name=1.1.181><b>IRINA.</b> I don't like this Soleni of yours and I'm afraid of him. He only<br>
        says silly things.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.182><b>TUZENBACH.</b> He's a queer man. I'm sorry for him, though he vexes me. I<br>

        and very good company; when other people are about he's rough and<br>
        hectoring. Don't let's go in, let them have their meal without us. Let<br>
        me stay with you. What are you thinking of? [Pause] You're twenty. I'm<br>
        not yet thirty. How many years are there left to us, with their long,<br>
        long lines of days, filled with my love for you....</a><br>

        about?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.185><b>IRINA.</b> You say that life is beautiful. Yes, if only it seems so! The<br>
        life of us three hasn't been beautiful yet; it has been stifling us as<br>
        if it was weeds... I'm crying. I oughtn't.... [Dries her tears, smiles]<br>
        We must work, work. That is why we are unhappy and look at the world so<br>
        sadly; we don't know what work is. Our parents despised work....</a><br>

<a name=1.1.190><b>NATASHA.</b> Is it a sign of anything?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.191><b>OLGA.</b> No, it simply doesn't go well... and it looks so queer.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.192><b>NATASHA.</b> [In a tearful voice] Yes? But it isn't really green, it's too<br>

        moment.... [Takes another] That's two. Now we're ready!</a><br>
<p>[They take the basket and go into the dining-room, where they have a<br>
        noisy reception.]</p>
<a name=1.1.210><b>RODE.</b> [Loudly] Congratulations and best wishes! Lovely weather to-day,<br>
        simply perfect. Was out walking with the High School students all the<br>
        morning. I take their drills.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.211><b>FEDOTIK.</b> You may move, Irina Sergeyevna! [Takes a photograph] You look<br>
        well to-day. [Takes a humming-top out of his pocket] Here's a<br>
        humming-top, by the way. It's got a lovely note!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.212><b>IRINA.</b> How awfully nice!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.213><b>MASHA.</b>"There stands a green oak by the sea,<br>
        And a chain of bright gold is around it...<br>
        And a chain of bright gold is around it..."[Tearfully] What am I saying that for? I've had those words running in<br>
        my head all day....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.214><b>KULIGIN.</b> There are thirteen at table!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.215><b>RODE.</b> [Aloud] Surely you don't believe in that superstition? [Laughter.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.216><b>KULIGIN.</b> If there are thirteen at table then it means there are lovers<br>
        present. It isn't you, Ivan Romanovitch, hang it all.... [Laughter.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.217><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> I'm a hardened sinner, but I really don't see why Natalia<br>
        Ivanovna should blush....</a><br>
<p>[Loud laughter; NATASHA runs out into the sitting-room, followed by<br>
        ANDREY.]</p>
<a name=1.1.218><b>ANDREY.</b> Don't pay any attention to them! Wait... do stop, please....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.219><b>NATASHA.</b> I'm shy... I don't know what's the matter with me and they're<br>
        all laughing at me. It wasn't nice of me to leave the table like that,<br>
        but I can't... I can't. [Covers her face with her hands.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.220><b>ANDREY.</b> My dear, I beg you. I implore you not to excite yourself. I<br>
        assure you they're only joking, they're kind people. My dear, good girl,<br>
        they're all kind and sincere people, and they like both you and me. Come<br>
        here to the window, they can't see us here.... [Looks round.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.221><b>NATASHA.</b> I'm so unaccustomed to meeting people!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.222><b>ANDREY.</b> Oh your youth, your splendid, beautiful youth! My darling, don't<br>
        be so excited! Believe me, believe me... I'm so happy, my soul is full<br>
        of love, of ecstasy.... They don't see us! They can't! Why, why or when<br>
        did I fall in love with you&mdash;Oh, I can't understand anything. My<br>
        dear, my pure darling, be my wife! I love you, love you... as never<br>
        before.... [They kiss.]</a><br>

<h3>ACT II</h3>
<p>[Scene as before. It is 8 p.m. Somebody is heard playing a concertina<br>
        outside in' the street. There is no fire. NATALIA IVANOVNA enters in<br>
        indoor dress carrying a candle; she stops by the door which leads into<br>
        ANDREY'S room.]</p>
<a name=1.2.223><b>NATASHA.</b> What are you doing, Andrey? Are you reading? It's nothing, only<br>
        I.... [She opens another door, and looks in, then closes it] Isn't there<br>
        any fire....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.224><b>ANDREY.</b> [Enters with book in hand] What are you doing, Natasha?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.225><b>NATASHA.</b> I was looking to see if there wasn't a fire. It's Shrovetide,<br>
        and the servant is simply beside herself; I must look out that something<br>
        doesn't happen. When I came through the dining-room yesterday midnight,<br>
        there was a candle burning. I couldn't get her to tell me who had<br>
        lighted it. [Puts down her candle] What's the time?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.226><b>ANDREY.</b> [Looks at his watch] A quarter past eight.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.227><b>NATASHA.</b> And Olga and Irina aren't in yet. The poor things are still at<br>
        work. Olga at the teacher's council, Irina at the telegraph office....<br>
        [Sighs] I said to your sister this morning, "Irina, darling, you must<br>
        take care of yourself." But she pays no attention. Did you say it was a<br>
        quarter past eight? I am afraid little Bobby is quite ill. Why is he so<br>
        cold? He was feverish yesterday, but to-day he is quite cold... I am so<br>
        frightened!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.228><b>ANDREY.</b> It's all right, Natasha. The boy is well.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.229><b>NATASHA.</b> Still, I think we ought to put him on a diet. I am so afraid.<br>
        And the entertainers were to be here after nine; they had better not<br>
        come, Audrey.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.230><b>ANDREY.</b> I don't know. After all, they were asked.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.231><b>NATASHA.</b> This morning, when the little boy woke up and saw me he<br>
        suddenly smiled; that means he knew me. "Good morning, Bobby!" I said,<br>
        "good morning, darling." And he laughed. Children understand, they<br>
        understand very well. So I'll tell them, Andrey dear, not to receive the<br>
        entertainers.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.232><b>ANDREY.</b> [Hesitatingly] But what about my sisters. This is their flat.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.233><b>NATASHA.</b> They'll do as I want them. They are so kind.... [Going] I<br>
        ordered sour milk for supper. The doctor says you must eat sour milk and<br>
        nothing else, or you won't get thin. [Stops] Bobby is so cold. I'm<br>
        afraid his room is too cold for him. It would be nice to put him into<br>
        another room till the warm weather comes. Irina's room, for instance, is<br>
        just right for a child: it's dry and has the sun all day. I must tell<br>
        her, she can share Olga's room. It isn't as if she was at home in the<br>
        daytime, she only sleeps here.... [A pause] Andrey, darling, why are you<br>
        so silent?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.234><b>ANDREY.</b> I was just thinking.... There is really nothing to say....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.235><b>NATASHA.</b> Yes... there was something I wanted to tell you.... Oh, yes.<br>
        Ferapont has come from the Council offices, he wants to see you.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.236><b>ANDREY.</b> [Yawns] Call him here.</a><br>
<p>[NATASHA goes out; ANDREY reads his book, stooping over the candle she<br>
        has left behind. FERAPONT enters; he wears a tattered old coat with the<br>
        collar up. His ears are muffled.]</p>
<a name=1.2.237><b>ANDREY.</b> Good morning, grandfather. What have you to say?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.238><b>FERAPONT.</b> The Chairman sends a book and some documents or other.<br>
        Here.... [Hands him a book and a packet.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.239><b>ANDREY.</b> Thank you. It's all right. Why couldn't you come earlier? It's<br>
        past eight now.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.240><b>FERAPONT.</b> What?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.241><b>ANDREY.</b> [Louder]. I say you've come late, it's past eight.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.242><b>FERAPONT.</b> Yes, yes. I came when it was still light, but they wouldn't<br>
        let me in. They said you were busy. Well, what was I to do. If you're<br>
        busy, you're busy, and I'm in no hurry. [He thinks that ANDREY is asking<br>
        him something] What?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.243><b>ANDREY.</b> Nothing. [Looks through the book] To-morrow's Friday. I'm not<br>
        supposed to go to work, but I'll come&mdash;all the same... and do some<br>
        work. It's dull at home. [Pause] Oh, my dear old man, how strangely life<br>
        changes, and how it deceives! To-day, out of sheer boredom, I took up<br>
        this book&mdash;old university lectures, and I couldn't help laughing.<br>
        My God, I'm secretary of the local district council, the council which<br>
        has Protopopov for its chairman, yes, I'm the secretary, and the summit<br>
        of my ambitions is&mdash;to become a member of the council! I to be a<br>
        member of the local district council, I, who dream every night that I'm<br>
        a professor of Moscow University, a famous scholar of whom all Russia is<br>
        proud!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.244><b>FERAPONT.</b> I can't tell... I'm hard of hearing....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.245><b>ANDREY.</b> If you weren't, I don't suppose I should talk to you. I've got<br>
        to talk to somebody, and my wife doesn't understand me, and I'm a bit<br>
        afraid of my sisters&mdash;I don't know why unless it is that they may<br>
        make fun of me and make me feel ashamed... I don't drink, I don't like<br>
        public-houses, but how I should like to be sitting just now in Tyestov's<br>
        place in Moscow, or at the Great Moscow, old fellow!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.246><b>FERAPONT.</b> Moscow? That's where a contractor was once telling that some<br>
        merchants or other were eating pancakes; one ate forty pancakes and he<br>
        went and died, he was saying. Either forty or fifty, I forget which.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.247><b>ANDREY.</b> In Moscow you can sit in an enormous restaurant where you don't<br>
        know anybody and where nobody knows you, and you don't feel all the same<br>
        that you're a stranger. And here you know everybody and everybody knows<br>
        you, and you're a stranger... and a lonely stranger.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.248><b>FERAPONT.</b> What? And the same contractor was telling&mdash;perhaps he was<br>
        lying&mdash;that there was a cable stretching right across Moscow.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.249><b>ANDREY.</b> What for?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.250><b>FERAPONT.</b> I can't tell. The contractor said so.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.251><b>ANDREY.</b> Rubbish. [He reads] Were you ever in Moscow?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.252><b>FERAPONT.</b> [After a pause] No. God did not lead me there. [Pause] Shall I<br>
        go?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.253><b>ANDREY.</b> You may go. Good-bye. [FERAPONT goes] Good-bye. [Reads] You can<br>
        come to-morrow and fetch these documents.... Go along.... [Pause] He's<br>
        gone. [A ring] Yes, yes.... [Stretches himself and slowly goes into his<br>
        own room.]</a><br>
<p>[Behind the scene the nurse is singing a lullaby to the child. MASHA and<br>
        VERSHININ come in. While they talk, a maidservant lights candles and a<br>
        lamp.]</p>
<a name=1.2.254><b>MASHA.</b> I don't know. [Pause] I don't know. Of course, habit counts for a<br>
        great deal. After father's death, for instance, it took us a long time<br>
        to get used to the absence of orderlies. But, apart from habit, it seems<br>
        to me in all fairness that, however it may be in other towns, the best<br>
        and most-educated people are army men.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.255><b>VERSHININ.</b> I'm thirsty. I should like some tea.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.256><b>MASHA.</b> [Glancing at her watch] They'll bring some soon. I was given in<br>
        marriage when I was eighteen, and I was afraid of my husband because he<br>
        was a teacher and I'd only just left school. He then seemed to me<br>
        frightfully wise and learned and important. And now, unfortunately, that<br>
        has changed.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.257><b>VERSHININ.</b> Yes... yes.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.258><b>MASHA.</b> I don't speak of my husband, I've grown used to him, but<br>
        civilians in general are so often coarse, impolite, uneducated. Their<br>
        rudeness offends me, it angers me. I suffer when I see that a man isn't<br>
        quite sufficiently refined, or delicate, or polite. I simply suffer<br>
        agonies when I happen to be among schoolmasters, my husband's<br>
        colleagues.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.259><b>VERSHININ.</b> Yes.... It seems to me that civilians and army men are<br>
        equally interesting, in this town, at any rate. It's all the same! If<br>
        you listen to a member of the local intelligentsia, whether to civilian<br>
        or military, he will tell you that he's sick of his wife, sick of his<br>
        house, sick of his estate, sick of his horses.... We Russians are<br>
        extremely gifted in the direction of thinking on an exalted plane, but,<br>
        tell me, why do we aim so low in real life? Why?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.260><b>MASHA.</b> Why?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.261><b>VERSHININ.</b> Why is a Russian sick of his children, sick of his wife? And<br>
        why are his wife and children sick of him?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.262><b>MASHA.</b> You're a little downhearted to-day.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.263><b>VERSHININ.</b> Perhaps I am. I haven't had any dinner, I've had nothing<br>
        since the morning. My daughter is a little unwell, and when my girls are<br>
        ill, I get very anxious and my conscience tortures me because they have<br>
        such a mother. Oh, if you had seen her to-day! What a trivial<br>
        personality! We began quarrelling at seven in the morning and at nine I<br>
        slammed the door and went out. [Pause] I never speak of her, it's<br>
        strange that I bear my complaints to you alone. [Kisses her hand] Don't<br>
        be angry with me. I haven't anybody but you, nobody at all.... [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.264><b>MASHA.</b> What a noise in the oven. Just before father's death there was a<br>
        noise in the pipe, just like that.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.265><b>VERSHININ.</b> Are you superstitious?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.266><b>MASHA.</b> Yes.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.267><b>VERSHININ.</b> That's strange. [Kisses her hand] You are a splendid,<br>
        wonderful woman. Splendid, wonderful! It is dark here, but I see your<br>
        sparkling eyes.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.268><b>MASHA.</b> [Sits on another chair] There is more light here.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.269><b>VERSHININ.</b> I love you, love you, love you... I love your eyes, your<br>
        movements, I dream of them.... Splendid, wonderful woman!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.270><b>MASHA.</b> [Laughing] When you talk to me like that, I laugh; I don't know<br>
        why, for I'm afraid. Don't repeat it, please.... [In an undertone] No,<br>
        go on, it's all the same to me.... [Covers her face with her hands]<br>
        Somebody's coming, let's talk about something else.</a><br>
<p>[IRINA and TUZENBACH come in through the dining-room.]</p>
<a name=1.2.271><b>TUZENBACH.</b> My surname is really triple. I am called Baron<br>
        Tuzenbach-Krone-Altschauer, but I am Russian and Orthodox, the same as<br>
        you. There is very little German left in me, unless perhaps it is the<br>
        patience and the obstinacy with which I bore you. I see you home every<br>
        night.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.272><b>IRINA.</b> How tired I am!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.273><b>TUZENBACH.</b> And I'll come to the telegraph office to see you home every<br>
        day for ten or twenty years, until you drive me away. [He sees MASHA and<br>
        VERSHININ; joyfully] Is that you? How do you do.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.274><b>IRINA.</b> Well, I am home at last. [To MASHA] A lady came to-day to<br>
        telegraph to her brother in Saratov that her son died to-day, and she<br>
        couldn't remember the address anyhow. So she sent the telegram without<br>
        an address, just to Saratov. She was crying. And for some reason or<br>
        other I was rude to her. "I've no time," I said. It was so stupid. Are<br>
        the entertainers coming to-night?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.275><b>MASHA.</b> Yes.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.276><b>IRINA.</b> [Sitting down in an armchair] I want a rest. I am tired.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.277><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Smiling] When you come home from your work you seem so<br>
        young, and so unfortunate.... [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.278><b>IRINA.</b> I am tired. No, I don't like the telegraph office, I don't like<br>
        it.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.279><b>MASHA.</b> You've grown thinner.... [Whistles a little] And you look<br>
        younger, and your face has become like a boy's.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.280><b>TUZENBACH.</b> That's the way she does her hair.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.281><b>IRINA.</b> I must find another job, this one won't do for me. What I wanted,<br>
        what I hoped to get, just that is lacking here. Labour without poetry,<br>
        without ideas.... [A knock on the floor] The doctor is knocking. [To<br>
        TUZENBACH] Will you knock, dear. I can't... I'm tired.... [TUZENBACH<br>
        knocks] He'll come in a minute. Something ought to be done. Yesterday<br>
        the doctor and Andrey played cards at the club and lost money. Andrey<br>
        seems to have lost 200 roubles.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.282><b>MASHA.</b> [With indifference] What can we do now?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.283><b>IRINA.</b> He lost money a fortnight ago, he lost money in December. Perhaps<br>
        if he lost everything we should go away from this town. Oh, my God, I<br>
        dream of Moscow every night. I'm just like a lunatic. [Laughs] We go<br>
        there in June, and before June there's still... February, March, April,<br>
        May... nearly half a year!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.284><b>MASHA.</b> Only Natasha mustn't get to know of these losses.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.285><b>IRINA.</b> I expect it will be all the same to her.</a><br>
<p>[CHEBUTIKIN, who has only just got out of bed&mdash;he was resting after<br>
        dinner&mdash;comes into the dining-room and combs his beard. He then<br>
        sits by the table and takes a newspaper from his pocket.]</p>
<a name=1.2.286><b>MASHA.</b> Here he is.... Has he paid his rent?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.287><b>IRINA.</b> [Laughs] No. He's been here eight months and hasn't paid a<br>
        copeck. Seems to have forgotten.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.288><b>MASHA.</b> [Laughs] What dignity in his pose! [They all laugh. A pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.289><b>IRINA.</b> Why are you so silent, Alexander Ignateyevitch?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.290><b>VERSHININ.</b> I don't know. I want some tea. Half my life for a tumbler of<br>
        tea: I haven't had anything since morning.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.291><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Irina Sergeyevna!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.292><b>IRINA.</b> What is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.293><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Please come here, Venez ici. [IRINA goes and sits by the<br>
        table] I can't do without you. [IRINA begins to play patience.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.294><b>VERSHININ.</b> Well, if we can't have any tea, let's philosophize, at any<br>
        rate.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.295><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Yes, let's. About what?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.296><b>VERSHININ.</b> About what? Let us meditate... about life as it will be after<br>
        our time; for example, in two or three hundred years.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.297><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Well? After our time people will fly about in balloons, the<br>
        cut of one's coat will change, perhaps they'll discover a sixth sense<br>
        and develop it, but life will remain the same, laborious, mysterious,<br>
        and happy. And in a thousand years' time, people will still be sighing:<br>
        "Life is hard!"&mdash;and at the same time they'll be just as afraid of<br>
        death, and unwilling to meet it, as we are.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.298><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Thoughtfully] How can I put it? It seems to me that<br>
        everything on earth must change, little by little, and is already<br>
        changing under our very eyes. After two or three hundred years, after a<br>
        thousand&mdash;the actual time doesn't matter&mdash;a new and happy age<br>
        will begin. We, of course, shall not take part in it, but we live and<br>
        work and even suffer to-day that it should come. We create it&mdash;and<br>
        in that one object is our destiny and, if you like, our happiness.</a><br>
<p>[MASHA laughs softly.]</p>
<a name=1.2.299><b>TUZENBACH.</b> What is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.300><b>MASHA.</b> I don't know. I've been laughing all day, ever since morning.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.301><b>VERSHININ.</b> I finished my education at the same point as you, I have not<br>
        studied at universities; I read a lot, but I cannot choose my books and<br>
        perhaps what I read is not at all what I should, but the longer I love,<br>
        the more I want to know. My hair is turning white, I am nearly an old<br>
        man now, but I know so little, oh, so little! But I think I know the<br>
        things that matter most, and that are most real. I know them well. And I<br>
        wish I could make you understand that there is no happiness for us, that<br>
        there should not and cannot be.... We must only work and work, and<br>
        happiness is only for our distant posterity. [Pause] If not for me, then<br>
        for the descendants of my descendants.</a><br>
<p>[FEDOTIK and RODE come into the dining-room; they sit and sing softly,<br>
        strumming on a guitar.]</p>
<a name=1.2.302><b>TUZENBACH.</b> According to you, one should not even think about happiness!<br>
        But suppose I am happy!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.303><b>VERSHININ.</b> No.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.304><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Moves his hands and laughs] We do not seem to understand<br>
        each other. How can I convince you? [MASHA laughs quietly, TUZENBACH<br>
        continues, pointing at her] Yes, laugh! [To VERSHININ] Not only after<br>
        two or three centuries, but in a million years, life will still be as it<br>
        was; life does not change, it remains for ever, following its own laws<br>
        which do not concern us, or which, at any rate, you will never find out.<br>
        Migrant birds, cranes for example, fly and fly, and whatever thoughts,<br>
        high or low, enter their heads, they will still fly and not know why or<br>
        where. They fly and will continue to fly, whatever philosophers come to<br>
        life among them; they may philosophize as much as they like, only they<br>
        will fly....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.305><b>MASHA.</b> Still, is there a meaning?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.306><b>TUZENBACH.</b> A meaning.... Now the snow is falling. What meaning? [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.307><b>MASHA.</b> It seems to me that a man must have faith, or must search for a<br>
        faith, or his life will be empty, empty.... To live and not to know why<br>
        the cranes fly, why babies are born, why there are stars in the sky....<br>
        Either you must know why you live, or everything is trivial, not worth a<br>
        straw. [A pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.308><b>VERSHININ.</b> Still, I am sorry that my youth has gone.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.309><b>MASHA.</b> Gogol says: life in this world is a dull matter, my masters!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.310><b>TUZENBACH.</b> And I say it's difficult to argue with you, my masters! Hang<br>
        it all.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.311><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Reading] Balzac was married at Berdichev. [IRINA is singing<br>
        softly] That's worth making a note of. [He makes a note] Balzac was<br>
        married at Berdichev. [Goes on reading.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.312><b>IRINA.</b> [Laying out cards, thoughtfully] Balzac was married at Berdichev.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.313><b>TUZENBACH.</b> The die is cast. I've handed in my resignation, Maria<br>
        Sergeyevna.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.314><b>MASHA.</b> So I heard. I don't see what good it is; I don't like civilians.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.315><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Never mind.... [Gets up] I'm not handsome; what use am I as a<br>
        soldier? Well, it makes no difference... I shall work. If only just once<br>
        in my life I could work so that I could come home in the evening, fall<br>
        exhausted on my bed, and go to sleep at once. [Going into the<br>
        dining-room] Workmen, I suppose, do sleep soundly!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.316><b>FEDOTIK.</b> [To IRINA] I bought some coloured pencils for you at Pizhikov's<br>
        in the Moscow Road, just now. And here is a little knife.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.317><b>IRINA.</b> You have got into the habit of behaving to me as if I am a little<br>
        girl, but I am grown up. [Takes the pencils and the knife, then, with<br>
        joy] How lovely!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.318><b>FEDOTIK.</b> And I bought myself a knife... look at it... one blade,<br>
        another, a third, an ear-scoop, scissors, nail-cleaners.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.319><b>RODE.</b> [Loudly] Doctor, how old are you?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.320><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> I? Thirty-two. [Laughter]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.321><b>FEDOTIK.</b> I'll show you another kind of patience.... [Lays out cards.]</a><br>
<p>[A samovar is brought in; ANFISA attends to it; a little later NATASHA<br>
        enters and helps by the table; SOLENI arrives and, after greetings, sits<br>
        by the table.]</p>
<a name=1.2.322><b>VERSHININ.</b> What a wind!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.323><b>MASHA.</b> Yes. I'm tired of winter. I've already forgotten what summer's<br>
        like.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.324><b>IRINA.</b> It's coming out, I see. We're going to Moscow.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.325><b>FEDOTIK.</b> No, it won't come out. Look, the eight was on the two of<br>
        spades. [Laughs] That means you won't go to Moscow.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.326><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Reading paper] Tsitsigar. Smallpox is raging here.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.327><b>ANFISA.</b> [Coming up to MASHA] Masha, have some tea, little mother. [To<br>
        VERSHININ] Please have some, sir... excuse me, but I've forgotten your<br>
        name....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.328><b>MASHA.</b> Bring some here, nurse. I shan't go over there.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.329><b>IRINA.</b> Nurse!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.330><b>ANFISA.</b> Coming, coming!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.331><b>NATASHA.</b> [To SOLENI] Children at the breast understand perfectly. I said<br>
        "Good morning, Bobby; good morning, dear!" And he looked at me in quite<br>
        an unusual way. You think it's only the mother in me that is speaking; I<br>
        assure you that isn't so! He's a wonderful child.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.332><b>SOLENI.</b> If he was my child I'd roast him on a frying-pan and eat him.<br>
        [Takes his tumbler into the drawing-room and sits in a corner.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.333><b>NATASHA.</b> [Covers her face in her hands] Vulgar, ill-bred man!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.334><b>MASHA.</b> He's lucky who doesn't notice whether it's winter now, or summer.<br>
        I think that if I were in Moscow, I shouldn't mind about the weather.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.335><b>VERSHININ.</b> A few days ago I was reading the prison diary of a French<br>
        minister. He had been sentenced on account of the Panama scandal. With<br>
        what joy, what delight, he speaks of the birds he saw through the prison<br>
        windows, which he had never noticed while he was a minister. Now, of<br>
        course, that he is at liberty, he notices birds no more than he did<br>
        before. When you go to live in Moscow you'll not notice it, in just the<br>
        same way. There can be no happiness for us, it only exists in our<br>
        wishes.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.336><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Takes cardboard box from the table] Where are the pastries?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.337><b>IRINA.</b> Soleni has eaten them.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.338><b>TUZENBACH.</b> All of them?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.339><b>ANFISA.</b> [Serving tea] There's a letter for you.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.340><b>VERSHININ.</b> For me? [Takes the letter] From my daughter. [Reads] Yes, of<br>
        course... I will go quietly. Excuse me, Maria Sergeyevna. I shan't have<br>
        any tea. [Stands up, excited] That eternal story....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.341><b>MASHA.</b> What is it? Is it a secret?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.342><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Quietly] My wife has poisoned herself again. I must go. I'll<br>
        go out quietly. It's all awfully unpleasant. [Kisses MASHA'S hand] My<br>
        dear, my splendid, good woman... I'll go this way, quietly. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.343><b>ANFISA.</b> Where has he gone? And I'd served tea.... What a man.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.344><b>MASHA.</b> [Angrily] Be quiet! You bother so one can't have a moment's<br>
        peace.... [Goes to the table with her cup] I'm tired of you, old woman!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.345><b>ANFISA.</b> My dear! Why are you offended!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.346><b>ANDREY'S VOICE.</b> Anfisa!</a><br>

<a name=1.2.348><b>MASHA.</b> [In the dining-room, by the table angrily] Let me sit down!<br>
        [Disturbs the cards on the table] Here you are, spreading your cards<br>
        out. Have some tea!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.349><b>IRINA.</b> You are cross, Masha.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.350><b>MASHA.</b> If I am cross, then don't talk to me. Don't touch me!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.351><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Don't touch her, don't touch her....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.352><b>MASHA.</b> You're sixty, but you're like a boy, always up to some beastly<br>
        nonsense.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.353><b>NATASHA.</b> [Sighs] Dear Masha, why use such expressions? With your<br>
        beautiful exterior you would be simply fascinating in good society, I<br>
        tell you so directly, if it wasn't for your words.Je vous prie,<br>
        pardonnez moi, Marie, mais vous avez des maniËres un peu grossiËres.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.354><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Restraining his laughter] Give me... give me... there's some<br>
        cognac, I think.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.355><b>NATASHA.</b>Il parait, que mon Bobick dÈj‡ ne dort pas, he has<br>
        awakened. He isn't well to-day. I'll go to him, excuse me... [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.356><b>IRINA.</b> Where has Alexander Ignateyevitch gone?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.357><b>MASHA.</b> Home. Something extraordinary has happened to his wife again.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.358><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Goes to SOLENI with a cognac-flask in his hands] You go on<br>
        sitting by yourself, thinking of something&mdash;goodness knows what.<br>
        Come and let's make peace. Let's have some cognac. [They drink] I expect<br>
        I'll have to play the piano all night, some rubbish most likely... well,<br>
        so be it!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.359><b>SOLENI.</b> Why make peace? I haven't quarrelled with you.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.360><b>TUZENBACH.</b> You always make me feel as if something has taken place<br>
        between us. You've a strange character, you must admit.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.361><b>SOLENI.</b> [Declaims] "I am strange, but who is not? Don't be angry,<br>
        Aleko!"</a><br>
<a name=1.2.362><b>TUZENBACH.</b> And what has Aleko to do with it? [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.363><b>SOLENI.</b> When I'm with one other man I behave just like everybody else,<br>
        but in company I'm dull and shy and... talk all manner of rubbish. But<br>
        I'm more honest and more honourable than very, very many people. And I<br>
        can prove it.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.364><b>TUZENBACH.</b> I often get angry with you, you always fasten on to me in<br>
        company, but I like you all the same. I'm going to drink my fill<br>
        to-night, whatever happens. Drink, now!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.365><b>SOLENI.</b> Let's drink. [They drink] I never had anything against you,<br>
        Baron. But my character is like Lermontov's [In a low voice] I even<br>
        rather resemble Lermontov, they say.... [Takes a scent-bottle from his<br>
        pocket, and scents his hands.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.366><b>TUZENBACH.</b> I've sent in my resignation. Basta! I've been thinking about<br>
        it for five years, and at last made up my mind. I shall work.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.367><b>SOLENI.</b> [Declaims] "Do not be angry, Aleko... forget, forget, thy dreams<br>
        of yore...."</a><br>
<p>[While he is speaking ANDREY enters quietly with a book, and sits by the<br>
        table.]</p>
<a name=1.2.368><b>TUZENBACH.</b> I shall work.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.369><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Going with IRINA into the dining-room] And the food was<br>
        also real Caucasian onion soup, and, for a roast, some chehartma.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.370><b>SOLENI.</b> Cheremsha [Note: A variety of garlic.] isn't meat at all, but a<br>
        plant something like an onion.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.371><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> No, my angel. Chehartma isn't onion, but roast mutton.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.372><b>SOLENI.</b> And I tell you, chehartma&mdash;is a sort of onion.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.373><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> And I tell you, chehartma&mdash;is mutton.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.374><b>SOLENI.</b> And I tell you, cheremsha&mdash;is a sort of onion.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.375><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> What's the use of arguing! You've never been in the<br>
        Caucasus, and never ate any chehartma.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.376><b>SOLENI.</b> I never ate it, because I hate it. It smells like garlic.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.377><b>ANDREY.</b> [Imploring] Please, please! I ask you!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.378><b>TUZENBACH.</b> When are the entertainers coming?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.379><b>IRINA.</b> They promised for about nine; that is, quite soon.</a><br>

        nursery is cold and damp. And your room would be so nice for the child.<br>
        My dear, darling girl, do change over to Olga's for a bit!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.429><b>IRINA.</b> [Not understanding] Where?</a><br>
<p>[The bells of a troika are heard as it drives up to the house.]</p>
<a name=1.2.430><b>NATASHA.</b> You and Olga can share a room, for the time being, and Bobby<br>
        can have yours. He's such a darling; to-day I said to him, "Bobby,<br>
        you're mine! Mine!" And he looked at me with his dear little eyes. [A<br>
        bell rings] It must be Olga. How late she is! [The maid enters and<br>
        whispers to NATASHA] Protopopov? What a queer man to do such a thing.<br>
        Protopopov's come and wants me to go for a drive with him in his troika.<br>
        [Laughs] How funny these men are.... [A bell rings] Somebody has come.<br>
        Suppose I did go and have half an hour's drive.... [To the maid] Say I<br>
        shan't be long. [Bell rings] Somebody's ringing, it must be Olga.<br>
        [Exit.]</a><br>
<p>[The maid runs out; IRINA sits deep in thought; KULIGIN and OLGA enter,<br>
        followed by VERSHININ.]</p>
<a name=1.2.431><b>KULIGIN.</b> Well, there you are. And you said there was going to be a<br>
        party.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.432><b>VERSHININ.</b> It's queer; I went away not long ago, half an hour ago, and<br>
        they were expecting entertainers.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.433><b>IRINA.</b> They've all gone.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.434><b>KULIGIN.</b> Has Masha gone too? Where has she gone? And what's Protopopov<br>
        waiting for downstairs in his troika? Whom is he expecting?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.435><b>IRINA.</b> Don't ask questions... I'm tired.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.436><b>KULIGIN.</b> Oh, you're all whimsies....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.437><b>OLGA.</b> My committee meeting is only just over. I'm tired out. Our<br>
        chairwoman is ill, so I had to take her place. My head, my head is<br>
        aching.... [Sits] Andrey lost 200 roubles at cards yesterday... the<br>
        whole town is talking about it....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.438><b>KULIGIN.</b> Yes, my meeting tired me too. [Sits.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.439><b>VERSHININ.</b> My wife took it into her head to frighten me just now by<br>
        nearly poisoning herself. It's all right now, and I'm glad; I can rest<br>
        now.... But perhaps we ought to go away? Well, my best wishes, Feodor<br>
        Ilitch, let's go somewhere together! I can't, I absolutely can't stop at<br>
        home.... Come on!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.440><b>KULIGIN.</b> I'm tired. I won't go. [Gets up] I'm tired. Has my wife gone<br>
        home?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.441><b>IRINA.</b> I suppose so.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.442><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Kisses IRINA'S hand] Good-bye, I'm going to rest all day<br>
        to-morrow and the day after. Best wishes! [Going] I should like some<br>
        tea. I was looking forward to spending the whole evening in pleasant<br>
        company and&mdash;o, fallacem hominum spem!... Accusative case after an<br>
        interjection....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.443><b>VERSHININ.</b> Then I'll go somewhere by myself. [Exit with KULIGIN,<br>
        whistling.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.444><b>OLGA.</b> I've such a headache... Andrey has been losing money.... The whole<br>
        town is talking.... I'll go and lie down. [Going] I'm free to-morrow....<br>
        Oh, my God, what a mercy! I'm free to-morrow, I'm free the day after....<br>
        Oh my head, my head.... [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.445><b>IRINA.</b> [alone] They've all gone. Nobody's left.</a><br>
<p>[A concertina is being played in the street. The nurse sings.]</p>
<a name=1.2.446><b>NATASHA.</b> [in fur coat and cap, steps across the dining-room, followed by<br>
        the maid] I'll be back in half an hour. I'm only going for a little<br>
        drive. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.447><b>IRINA.</b> [Alone in her misery] To Moscow! Moscow! Moscow!</a><br>
<p>Curtain.</p>
<h3>ACT III</h3>
<p>[The room shared by OLGA and IRINA. Beds, screened off, on the right and<br>
        left. It is past 2 a.m. Behind the stage a fire-alarm is ringing; it has<br>
        apparently been going for some time. Nobody in the house has gone to bed<br>
        yet. MASHA is lying on a sofa dressed, as usual, in black. Enter OLGA<br>
        and ANFISA.]</p>
<a name=1.3.448><b>ANFISA.</b> Now they are downstairs, sitting under the stairs. I said to<br>
        them, "Won't you come up," I said, "You can't go on like this," and they<br>
        simply cried, "We don't know where father is." They said, "He may be<br>
        burnt up by now." What an idea! And in the yard there are some people...<br>
        also undressed.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.449><b>OLGA.</b> [Takes a dress out of the cupboard] Take this grey dress.... And<br>
        this... and the blouse as well.... Take the skirt, too, nurse.... My<br>
        God! How awful it is! The whole of the Kirsanovsky Road seems to have<br>
        burned down. Take this... and this.... [Throws clothes into her hands]<br>
        The poor Vershinins are so frightened.... Their house was nearly burnt.<br>
        They ought to come here for the night.... They shouldn't be allowed to<br>
        go home.... Poor Fedotik is completely burnt out, there's nothing<br>
        left....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.450><b>ANFISA.</b> Couldn't you call Ferapont, Olga dear. I can hardly manage....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.451><b>OLGA.</b> [Rings] They'll never answer.... [At the door] Come here, whoever<br>
        there is! [Through the open door can be seen a window, red with flame:<br>
        afire-engine is heard passing the house] How awful this is. And how I'm<br>
        sick of it! [FERAPONT enters] Take these things down.... The Kolotilin<br>
        girls are down below... and let them have them. This, too.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.452><b>FERAPONT.</b> Yes'm. In the year twelve Moscow was burning too. Oh, my God!<br>
        The Frenchmen were surprised.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.453><b>OLGA.</b> Go on, go on....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.454><b>FERAPONT.</b> Yes'm. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.455><b>OLGA.</b> Nurse, dear, let them have everything. We don't want anything.<br>
        Give it all to them, nurse.... I'm tired, I can hardly keep on my<br>
        legs.... The Vershinins mustn't be allowed to go home.... The girls can<br>
        sleep in the drawing-room, and Alexander Ignateyevitch can go downstairs<br>
        to the Baron's flat... Fedotik can go there, too, or else into our<br>
        dining-room.... The doctor is drunk, beastly drunk, as if on purpose, so<br>
        nobody can go to him. Vershinin's wife, too, may go into the<br>
        drawing-room.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.456><b>ANFISA.</b> [Tired] Olga, dear girl, don't dismiss me! Don't dismiss me!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.457><b>OLGA.</b> You're talking nonsense, nurse. Nobody is dismissing you.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.458><b>ANFISA.</b> [Puts OLGA'S head against her bosom] My dear, precious girl, I'm<br>
        working, I'm toiling away... I'm growing weak, and they'll all say go<br>
        away! And where shall I go? Where? I'm eighty. Eighty-one years old....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.459><b>OLGA.</b> You sit down, nurse dear.... You're tired, poor dear.... [Makes<br>
        her sit down] Rest, dear. You're so pale!</a><br>
<p>[NATASHA comes in.]</p>
<a name=1.3.460><b>NATASHA.</b> They are saying that a committee to assist the sufferers from<br>
        the fire must be formed at once. What do you think of that? It's a<br>
        beautiful idea. Of course the poor ought to be helped, it's the duty of<br>
        the rich. Bobby and little Sophy are sleeping, sleeping as if nothing at<br>
        all was the matter. There's such a lot of people here, the place is full<br>
        of them, wherever you go. There's influenza in the town now. I'm afraid<br>
        the children may catch it.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.461><b>OLGA.</b> [Not attending] In this room we can't see the fire, it's quiet<br>
        here.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.462><b>NATASHA.</b> Yes... I suppose I'm all untidy. [Before the looking-glass]<br>
        They say I'm growing stout... it isn't true! Certainly it isn't! Masha's<br>
        asleep; the poor thing is tired out.... [Coldly, to ANFISA] Don't dare<br>
        to be seated in my presence! Get up! Out of this! [Exit ANFISA; a pause]<br>
        I don't understand what makes you keep on that old woman!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.463><b>OLGA.</b> [Confusedly] Excuse me, I don't understand either...</a><br>
<a name=1.3.464><b>NATASHA.</b> She's no good here. She comes from the country, she ought to<br>
        live there.... Spoiling her, I call it! I like order in the house! We<br>
        don't want any unnecessary people here. [Strokes her cheek] You're<br>
        tired, poor thing! Our head mistress is tired! And when my little Sophie<br>
        grows up and goes to school I shall be so afraid of you.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.465><b>OLGA.</b> I shan't be head mistress.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.466><b>NATASHA.</b> They'll appoint you, Olga. It's settled.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.467><b>OLGA.</b> I'll refuse the post. I can't... I'm not strong enough.... [Drinks<br>
        water] You were so rude to nurse just now... I'm sorry. I can't stand<br>
        it... everything seems dark in front of me....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.468><b>NATASHA.</b> [Excited] Forgive me, Olga, forgive me... I didn't want to<br>
        annoy you.</a><br>
<p>[MASHA gets up, takes a pillow and goes out angrily.]</p>
<a name=1.3.469><b>OLGA.</b> Remember, dear... we have been brought up, in an unusual way,<br>
        perhaps, but I can't bear this. Such behaviour has a bad effect on me, I<br>
        get ill... I simply lose heart!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.470><b>NATASHA.</b> Forgive me, forgive me.... [Kisses her.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.471><b>OLGA.</b> Even the least bit of rudeness, the slightest impoliteness, upsets<br>
        me.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.472><b>NATASHA.</b> I often say too much, it's true, but you must agree, dear, that<br>
        she could just as well live in the country.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.473><b>OLGA.</b> She has been with us for thirty years.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.474><b>NATASHA.</b> But she can't do any work now. Either I don't understand, or<br>
        you don't want to understand me. She's no good for work, she can only<br>
        sleep or sit about.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.475><b>OLGA.</b> And let her sit about.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.476><b>NATASHA.</b> [Surprised] What do you mean? She's only a servant. [Crying] I<br>
        don't understand you, Olga. I've got a nurse, a wet-nurse, we've a cook,<br>
        a housemaid... what do we want that old woman for as well? What good is<br>
        she? [Fire-alarm behind the stage.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.477><b>OLGA.</b> I've grown ten years older to-night.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.478><b>NATASHA.</b> We must come to an agreement, Olga. Your place is the school,<br>
        mine&mdash;the home. You devote yourself to teaching, I, to the<br>
        household. And if I talk about servants, then I do know what I am<br>
        talking about; I do know what I am talking about... And to-morrow<br>
        there's to be no more of that old thief, that old hag... [Stamping] that<br>
        witch! And don't you dare to annoy me! Don't you dare! [Stopping short]<br>
        Really, if you don't move downstairs, we shall always be quarrelling.<br>
        This is awful.</a><br>
<p>[Enter KULIGIN.]</p>
<a name=1.3.479><b>KULIGIN.</b> Where's Masha? It's time we went home. The fire seems to be<br>
        going down. [Stretches himself] Only one block has burnt down, but there<br>
        was such a wind that it seemed at first the whole town was going to<br>
        burn. [Sits] I'm tired out. My dear Olga... I often think that if it<br>
        hadn't been for Masha, I should have married you. You are awfully<br>
        nice.... I am absolutely tired out. [Listens.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.480><b>OLGA.</b> What is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.481><b>KULIGIN.</b> The doctor, of course, has been drinking hard; he's terribly<br>
        drunk. He might have done it on purpose! [Gets up] He seems to be coming<br>
        here.... Do you hear him? Yes, here.... [Laughs] What a man... really...<br>
        I'll hide myself. [Goes to the cupboard and stands in the corner] What a<br>
        rogue.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.482><b>OLGA.</b> He hadn't touched a drop for two years, and now he suddenly goes<br>
        and gets drunk....</a><br>
<p>[Retires with NATASHA to the back of the room. CHEBUTIKIN enters;<br>
        apparently sober, he stops, looks round, then goes to the wash-stand and<br>
        begins to wash his hands.]</p>
<a name=1.3.483><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Angrily] Devil take them all... take them all.... They<br>
        think I'm a doctor and can cure everything, and I know absolutely<br>
        nothing, I've forgotten all I ever knew, I remember nothing, absolutely<br>
        nothing. [OLGA and NATASHA go out, unnoticed by him] Devil take it. Last<br>
        Wednesday I attended a woman in Zasip&mdash;and she died, and it's my<br>
        fault that she died. Yes... I used to know a certain amount<br>
        five-and-twenty years ago, but I don't remember anything now. Nothing.<br>
        Perhaps I'm not really a man, and am only pretending that I've got arms<br>
        and legs and a head; perhaps I don't exist at all, and only imagine that<br>
        I walk, and eat, and sleep. [Cries] Oh, if only I didn't exist! [Stops<br>
        crying; angrily] The devil only knows.... Day before yesterday they were<br>
        talking in the club; they said, Shakespeare, Voltaire... I'd never read,<br>
        never read at all, and I put on an expression as if I had read. And so<br>
        did the others. Oh, how beastly! How petty! And then I remembered the<br>
        woman I killed on Wednesday... and I couldn't get her out of my mind,<br>
        and everything in my mind became crooked, nasty, wretched.... So I went<br>
        and drank....</a><br>
<p>[IRINA, VERSHININ and TUZENBACH enter; TUZENBACH is wearing new and<br>
        fashionable civilian clothes.]</p>
<a name=1.3.484><b>IRINA.</b> Let's sit down here. Nobody will come in here.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.485><b>VERSHININ.</b> The whole town would have been destroyed if it hadn't been<br>
        for the soldiers. Good men! [Rubs his hands appreciatively] Splendid<br>
        people! Oh, what a fine lot!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.486><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Coming up to him] What's the time?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.487><b>TUZENBACH.</b> It's past three now. It's dawning.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.488><b>IRINA.</b> They are all sitting in the dining-room, nobody is going. And<br>
        that Soleni of yours is sitting there. [To CHEBUTIKIN] Hadn't you better<br>
        be going to sleep, doctor?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.489><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> It's all right... thank you.... [Combs his beard.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.490><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Laughs] Speaking's a bit difficult, eh, Ivan Romanovitch!<br>
        [Pats him on the shoulder] Good man!In vino veritas, the<br>
        ancients used to say.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.491><b>TUZENBACH.</b> They keep on asking me to get up a concert in aid of the<br>
        sufferers.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.492><b>IRINA.</b> As if one could do anything....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.493><b>TUZENBACH.</b> It might be arranged, if necessary. In my opinion Maria<br>
        Sergeyevna is an excellent pianist.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.494><b>KULIGIN.</b> Yes, excellent!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.495><b>IRINA.</b> She's forgotten everything. She hasn't played for three years...<br>
        or four.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.496><b>TUZENBACH.</b> In this town absolutely nobody understands music, not a soul<br>
        except myself, but I do understand it, and assure you on my word of<br>
        honour that Maria Sergeyevna plays excellently, almost with genius.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.497><b>KULIGIN.</b> You are right, Baron, I'm awfully fond of Masha. She's very<br>
        fine.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.498><b>TUZENBACH.</b> To be able to play so admirably and to realize at the same<br>
        time that nobody, nobody can understand you!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.499><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Sighs] Yes.... But will it be quite all right for her to take<br>
        part in a concert? [Pause] You see, I don't know anything about it.<br>
        Perhaps it will even be all to the good. Although I must admit that our<br>
        Director is a good man, a very good man even, a very clever man, still<br>
        he has such views.... Of course it isn't his business but still, if you<br>
        wish it, perhaps I'd better talk to him.</a><br>
<p>[CHEBUTIKIN takes a porcelain clock into his hands and examines it.]</p>
<a name=1.3.500><b>VERSHININ.</b> I got so dirty while the fire was on, I don't look like<br>
        anybody on earth. [Pause] Yesterday I happened to hear, casually, that<br>
        they want to transfer our brigade to some distant place. Some said to<br>
        Poland, others, to Chita.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.501><b>TUZENBACH.</b> I heard so, too. Well, if it is so, the town will be quite<br>
        empty.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.502><b>IRINA.</b> And we'll go away, too!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.503><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Drops the clock which breaks to pieces] To smithereens!</a><br>
<p>[A pause; everybody is pained and confused.]</p>
<a name=1.3.504><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Gathering up the pieces] To smash such a valuable object&mdash;oh,<br>
        Ivan Romanovitch, Ivan Romanovitch! A very bad mark for your<br>
        misbehaviour!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.505><b>IRINA.</b> That clock used to belong to our mother.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.506><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Perhaps.... To your mother, your mother. Perhaps I didn't<br>
        break it; it only looks as if I broke it. Perhaps we only think that we<br>
        exist, when really we don't. I don't know anything, nobody knows<br>
        anything. [At the door] What are you looking at? Natasha has a little<br>
        romance with Protopopov, and you don't see it.... There you sit and see<br>
        nothing, and Natasha has a little romance with Protopovov.... [Sings]<br>
        Won't you please accept this date.... [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.507><b>VERSHININ.</b> Yes. [Laughs] How strange everything really is! [Pause] When<br>
        the fire broke out, I hurried off home; when I get there I see the house<br>
        is whole, uninjured, and in no danger, but my two girls are standing by<br>
        the door in just their underclothes, their mother isn't there, the crowd<br>
        is excited, horses and dogs are running about, and the girls' faces are<br>
        so agitated, terrified, beseeching, and I don't know what else. My heart<br>
        was pained when I saw those faces. My God, I thought, what these girls<br>
        will have to put up with if they live long! I caught them up and ran,<br>
        and still kept on thinking the one thing: what they will have to live<br>
        through in this world! [Fire-alarm; a pause] I come here and find their<br>
        mother shouting and angry. [MASHA enters with a pillow and sits on the<br>
        sofa] And when my girls were standing by the door in just their<br>
        underclothes, and the street was red from the fire, there was a dreadful<br>
        noise, and I thought that something of the sort used to happen many<br>
        years ago when an enemy made a sudden attack, and looted, and burned....<br>
        And at the same time what a difference there really is between the<br>
        present and the past! And when a little more time has gone by, in two or<br>
        three hundred years perhaps, people will look at our present life with<br>
        just the same fear, and the same contempt, and the whole past will seem<br>
        clumsy and dull, and very uncomfortable, and strange. Oh, indeed, what a<br>
        life there will be, what a life! [Laughs] Forgive me, I've dropped into<br>
        philosophy again. Please let me continue. I do awfully want to<br>
        philosophize, it's just how I feel at present. [Pause] As if they are<br>
        all asleep. As I was saying: what a life there will be! Only just<br>
        imagine.... There are only three persons like yourselves in the town<br>
        just now, but in future generations there will be more and more, and<br>
        still more, and the time will come when everything will change and<br>
        become as you would have it, people will live as you do, and then you<br>
        too will go out of date; people will be born who are better than you....<br>
        [Laughs] Yes, to-day I am quite exceptionally in the vein. I am<br>
        devilishly keen on living.... [Sings.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.508><b>MASHA.</b> Trum-tum-tum...</a><br>
<a name=1.3.509><b>VERSHININ.</b> Tum-tum...</a><br>
<a name=1.3.510><b>MASHA.</b> Tra-ra-ra?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.511><b>VERSHININ.</b> Tra-ta-ta. [Laughs.]</a><br>
<p>[Enter FEDOTIK.]</p>
<a name=1.3.512><b>FEDOTIK.</b> [Dancing] I'm burnt out, I'm burnt out! Down to the ground!<br>
        [Laughter.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.513><b>IRINA.</b> I don't see anything funny about it. Is everything burnt?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.514><b>FEDOTIK.</b> [Laughs] Absolutely. Nothing left at all. The guitar's burnt,<br>
        and the photographs are burnt, and all my correspondence.... And I was<br>
        going to make you a present of a note-book, and that's burnt too.</a><br>
<p>[SOLENI comes in.]</p>
<a name=1.3.515><b>IRINA.</b> No, you can't come here, Vassili Vassilevitch. Please go away.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.516><b>SOLENI.</b> Why can the Baron come here and I can't?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.517><b>VERSHININ.</b> We really must go. How's the fire?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.518><b>SOLENI.</b> They say it's going down. No, I absolutely don't see why the<br>
        Baron can, and I can't? [Scents his hands.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.519><b>VERSHININ.</b> Trum-tum-tum.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.520><b>MASHA.</b> Trum-tum.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.521><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Laughs to SOLENI] Let's go into the dining-room.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.522><b>SOLENI.</b> Very well, we'll make a note of it. "If I should try to make<br>
        this clear, the geese would be annoyed, I fear." [Looks at TUZENBACH]<br>
        There, there, there.... [Goes out with VERSHININ and FEDOTIK.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.523><b>IRINA.</b> How Soleni smelt of tobacco.... [In surprise] The Baron's asleep!<br>
        Baron! Baron!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.524><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Waking] I am tired, I must say.... The brickworks.... No,<br>
        I'm not wandering, I mean it; I'm going to start work soon at the<br>
        brickworks... I've already talked it over. [Tenderly, to IRINA] You're<br>
        so pale, and beautiful, and charming.... Your paleness seems to shine<br>
        through the dark air as if it was a light.... You are sad, displeased<br>
        with life.... Oh, come with me, let's go and work together!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.525><b>MASHA.</b> Nicolai Lvovitch, go away from here.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.526><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Laughs] Are you here? I didn't see you. [Kisses IRINA'S<br>
        hand] good-bye, I'll go... I look at you now and I remember, as if it<br>
        was long ago, your name-day, when you, cheerfully and merrily, were<br>
        talking about the joys of labour.... And how happy life seemed to me,<br>
        then! What has happened to it now? [Kisses her hand] There are tears in<br>
        your eyes. Go to bed now; it is already day... the morning begins.... If<br>
        only I was allowed to give my life for you!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.527><b>MASHA.</b> Nicolai Lvovitch, go away! What business...</a><br>
<a name=1.3.528><b>TUZENBACH.</b> I'm off. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.529><b>MASHA.</b> [Lies down] Are you asleep, Feodor?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.530><b>KULIGIN.</b> Eh?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.531><b>MASHA.</b> Shouldn't you go home.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.532><b>KULIGIN.</b> My dear Masha, my darling Masha....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.533><b>IRINA.</b> She's tired out. You might let her rest, Fedia.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.534><b>KULIGIN.</b> I'll go at once. My wife's a good, splendid... I love you, my<br>
        only one....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.535><b>MASHA.</b> [Angrily] Amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis, amant.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.536><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Laughs] No, she really is wonderful. I've been your husband<br>
        seven years, and it seems as if I was only married yesterday. On my<br>
        word. No, you really are a wonderful woman. I'm satisfied, I'm<br>
        satisfied, I'm satisfied!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.537><b>MASHA.</b> I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored.... [Sits up] But I can't get it<br>
        out of my head.... It's simply disgraceful. It has been gnawing away at<br>
        me... I can't keep silent. I mean about Andrey.... He has mortgaged this<br>
        house with the bank, and his wife has got all the money; but the house<br>
        doesn't belong to him alone, but to the four of us! He ought to know<br>
        that, if he's an honourable man.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.538><b>KULIGIN.</b> What's the use, Masha? Andrey is in debt all round; well, let<br>
        him do as he pleases.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.539><b>MASHA.</b> It's disgraceful, anyway. [Lies down]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.540><b>KULIGIN.</b> You and I are not poor. I work, take my classes, give private<br>
        lessons... I am a plain, honest man...Omnia mea mecum porto, as<br>
        they say.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.541><b>MASHA.</b> I don't want anything, but the unfairness of it disgusts me.<br>
        [Pause] You go, Feodor.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.542><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Kisses her] You're tired, just rest for half an hour, and I'll<br>
        sit and wait for you. Sleep.... [Going] I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied,<br>
        I'm satisfied. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.543><b>IRINA.</b> Yes, really, our Andrey has grown smaller; how he's snuffed out<br>
        and aged with that woman! He used to want to be a professor, and<br>
        yesterday he was boasting that at last he had been made a member of the<br>
        district council. He is a member, and Protopopov is chairman.... The<br>
        whole town talks and laughs about it, and he alone knows and sees<br>
        nothing.... And now everybody's gone to look at the fire, but he sits<br>
        alone in his room and pays no attention, only just plays on his fiddle.<br>
        [Nervily] Oh, it's awful, awful, awful. [Weeps] I can't, I can't bear it<br>
        any longer!... I can't, I can't!... [OLGA comes in and clears up at her<br>
        little table. IRINA is sobbing loudly] Throw me out, throw me out, I<br>
        can't bear any more!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.544><b>OLGA.</b> [Alarmed] What is it, what is it? Dear!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.545><b>IRINA.</b> [Sobbing] Where? Where has everything gone? Where is it all? Oh<br>
        my God, my God! I've forgotten everything, everything... I don't<br>
        remember what is the Italian for window or, well, for ceiling... I<br>
        forget everything, every day I forget it, and life passes and will never<br>
        return, and we'll never go away to Moscow... I see that we'll never<br>
        go....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.546><b>OLGA.</b> Dear, dear....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.547><b>IRINA.</b> [Controlling herself] Oh, I am unhappy... I can't work, I shan't<br>
        work. Enough, enough! I used to be a telegraphist, now I work at the<br>
        town council offices, and I have nothing but hate and contempt for all<br>
        they give me to do... I am already twenty-three, I have already been at<br>
        work for a long while, and my brain has dried up, and I've grown<br>
        thinner, plainer, older, and there is no relief of any sort, and time<br>
        goes and it seems all the while as if I am going away from the real, the<br>
        beautiful life, farther and farther away, down some precipice. I'm in<br>
        despair and I can't understand how it is that I am still alive, that I<br>
        haven't killed myself.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.548><b>OLGA.</b> Don't cry, dear girl, don't cry... I suffer, too.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.549><b>IRINA.</b> I'm not crying, not crying.... Enough.... Look, I'm not crying<br>
        any more. Enough... enough!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.550><b>OLGA.</b> Dear, I tell you as a sister and a friend if you want my advice,<br>
        marry the Baron. [IRINA cries softly] You respect him, you think highly<br>
        of him.... It is true that he is not handsome, but he is so honourable<br>
        and clean... people don't marry from love, but in order to do one's<br>
        duty. I think so, at any rate, and I'd marry without being in love.<br>
        Whoever he was, I should marry him, so long as he was a decent man. Even<br>
        if he was old....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.551><b>IRINA.</b> I was always waiting until we should be settled in Moscow, there<br>
        I should meet my true love; I used to think about him, and love him....<br>
        But it's all turned out to be nonsense, all nonsense....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.552><b>OLGA.</b> [Embraces her sister] My dear, beautiful sister, I understand<br>
        everything; when Baron Nicolai Lvovitch left the army and came to us in<br>
        evening dress, [Note: I.e. in the correct dress for making a proposal of<br>
        marriage.] he seemed so bad-looking to me that I even started crying....<br>
        He asked, "What are you crying for?" How could I tell him! But if God<br>
        brought him to marry you, I should be happy. That would be different,<br>
        quite different.</a><br>
<p>[NATASHA with a candle walks across the stage from right to left without<br>
        saying anything.]</p>
<a name=1.3.553><b>MASHA.</b> [Sitting up] She walks as if she's set something on fire.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.554><b>OLGA.</b> Masha, you're silly, you're the silliest of the family. Please<br>
        forgive me for saying so. [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.555><b>MASHA.</b> I want to make a confession, dear sisters. My soul is in pain. I<br>
        will confess to you, and never again to anybody... I'll tell you this<br>
        minute. [Softly] It's my secret but you must know everything... I can't<br>
        be silent.... [Pause] I love, I love... I love that man.... You saw him<br>
        only just now.... Why don't I say it... in one word. I love Vershinin.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.556><b>OLGA.</b> [Goes behind her screen] Stop that, I don't hear you in any case.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.557><b>MASHA.</b> What am I to do? [Takes her head in her hands] First he seemed<br>
        queer to me, then I was sorry for him... then I fell in love with him...<br>
        fell in love with his voice, his words, his misfortunes, his two<br>
        daughters.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.558><b>OLGA.</b> [Behind the screen] I'm not listening. You may talk any nonsense<br>
        you like, it will be all the same, I shan't hear.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.559><b>MASHA.</b> Oh, Olga, you are foolish. I am in love&mdash;that means that is<br>
        to be my fate. It means that is to be my lot.... And he loves me.... It<br>
        is all awful. Yes; it isn't good, is it? [Takes IRINA'S hand and draws<br>
        her to her] Oh, my dear.... How are we going to live through our lives,<br>
        what is to become of us.... When you read a novel it all seems so old<br>
        and easy, but when you fall in love yourself, then you learn that nobody<br>
        knows anything, and each must decide for himself.... My dear ones, my<br>
        sisters... I've confessed, now I shall keep silence.... Like the<br>
        lunatics in Gogol's story, I'm going to be silent... silent...</a><br>
<p>[ANDREY enters, followed by FERAPONT.]</p>
<a name=1.3.560><b>ANDREY.</b> [Angrily] What do you want? I don't understand.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.561><b>FERAPONT.</b> [At the door, impatiently] I've already told you ten times,<br>
        Andrey Sergeyevitch.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.562><b>ANDREY.</b> In the first place I'm not Andrey Sergeyevitch, but sir. [Note:<br>
        Quite literally, "your high honour," to correspond to Andrey's rank as a<br>
        civil servant.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.563><b>FERAPONT.</b> The firemen, sir, ask if they can go across your garden to the<br>
        river. Else they go right round, right round; it's a nuisance.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.564><b>ANDREY.</b> All right. Tell them it's all right. [Exit FERAPONT] I'm tired<br>
        of them. Where is Olga? [OLGA comes out from behind the screen] I came<br>
        to you for the key of the cupboard. I lost my own. You've got a little<br>
        key. [OLGA gives him the key; IRINA goes behind her screen; pause] What<br>
        a huge fire! It's going down now. Hang it all, that Ferapont made me so<br>
        angry that I talked nonsense to him.... Sir, indeed.... [A pause] Why<br>
        are you so silent, Olga? [Pause] It's time you stopped all that nonsense<br>
        and behaved as if you were properly alive.... You are here, Masha. Irina<br>
        is here, well, since we're all here, let's come to a complete<br>
        understanding, once and for all. What have you against me? What is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.565><b>OLGA.</b> Please don't, Audrey dear. We'll talk to-morrow. [Excited] What an<br>
        awful night!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.566><b>ANDREY.</b> [Much confused] Don't excite yourself. I ask you in perfect<br>
        calmness; what have you against me? Tell me straight.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.567><b>VERSHININ'S VOICE.</b> Trum-tum-tum!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.568><b>MASHA.</b> [Stands; loudly] Tra-ta-ta! [To OLGA] Goodbye, Olga, God bless<br>
        you. [Goes behind screen and kisses IRINA] Sleep well.... Good-bye,<br>
        Andrey. Go away now, they're tired... you can explain to-morrow....<br>
        [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.569><b>ANDREY.</b> I'll only say this and go. Just now.... In the first place,<br>
        you've got something against Natasha, my wife; I've noticed it since the<br>
        very day of my marriage. Natasha is a beautiful and honest creature,<br>
        straight and honourable&mdash;that's my opinion. I love and respect my<br>
        wife; understand it, I respect her, and I insist that others should<br>
        respect her too. I repeat, she's an honest and honourable person, and<br>
        all your disapproval is simply silly... [Pause] In the second place, you<br>
        seem to be annoyed because I am not a professor, and am not engaged in<br>
        study. But I work for the zemstvo, I am a member of the district<br>
        council, and I consider my service as worthy and as high as the service<br>
        of science. I am a member of the district council, and I am proud of it,<br>
        if you want to know. [Pause] In the third place, I have still this to<br>
        say... that I have mortgaged the house without obtaining your<br>
        permission.... For that I am to blame, and ask to be forgiven. My debts<br>
        led me into doing it... thirty-five thousand... I do not play at cards<br>
        any more, I stopped long ago, but the chief thing I have to say in my<br>
        defence is that you girls receive a pension, and I don't... my wages, so<br>
        to speak.... [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.570><b>KULIGIN.</b> [At the door] Is Masha there? [Excitedly] Where is she? It's<br>
        queer.... [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.571><b>ANDREY.</b> They don't hear. Natasha is a splendid, honest person. [Walks<br>
        about in silence, then stops] When I married I thought we should be<br>
        happy... all of us.... But, my God.... [Weeps] My dear, dear sisters,<br>
        don't believe me, don't believe me.... [Exit.]</a><br>
<p>[Fire-alarm. The stage is clear.]</p>
<a name=1.3.572><b>IRINA.</b> [behind her screen] Olga, who's knocking on the floor?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.573><b>OLGA.</b> It's doctor Ivan Romanovitch. He's drunk.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.574><b>IRINA.</b> What a restless night! [Pause] Olga! [Looks out] Did you hear?<br>
        They are taking the brigade away from us; it's going to be transferred<br>
        to some place far away.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.575><b>OLGA.</b> It's only a rumour.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.576><b>IRINA.</b> Then we shall be left alone.... Olga!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.577><b>OLGA.</b> Well?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.578><b>IRINA.</b> My dear, darling sister, I esteem, I highly value the Baron, he's<br>
        a splendid man; I'll marry him, I'll consent, only let's go to Moscow! I<br>
        implore you, let's go! There's nothing better than Moscow on earth!<br>
        Let's go, Olga, let's go!</a><br>

<h3>ACT IV</h3>
<p>[The old garden at the house of the PROSOROVS. There is a long avenue of<br>
        firs, at the end of which the river can be seen. There is a forest on<br>
        the far side of the river. On the right is the terrace of the house:<br>
        bottles and tumblers are on a table here; it is evident that champagne<br>
        has just been drunk. It is midday. Every now and again passers-by walk<br>
        across the garden, from the road to the river; five soldiers go past<br>
        rapidly. CHEBUTIKIN, in a comfortable frame of mind which does not<br>
        desert him throughout the act, sits in an armchair in the garden,<br>
        waiting to be called. He wears a peaked cap and has a stick. IRINA,<br>
        KULIGIN with a cross hanging from his neck and without his moustaches,<br>
        and TUZENBACH are standing on the terrace seeing off FEDOTIK and RODE,<br>
        who are coming down into the garden; both officers are in service<br>
        uniform.]</p>
<a name=1.4.579><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Exchanges kisses with FEDOTIK] You're a good sort, we got on<br>
        so well together. [Exchanges kisses with RODE] Once again.... Good-bye,<br>
        old man!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.580><b>IRINA.</b> Au revoir!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.581><b>FEDOTIK.</b> It isn't au revoir, it's good-bye; we'll never meet again!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.582><b>KULIGIN.</b> Who knows! [Wipes his eyes; smiles] Here I've started crying!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.583><b>IRINA.</b> We'll meet again sometime.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.584><b>FEDOTIK.</b> After ten years&mdash;or fifteen? We'll hardly know one another<br>
        then; we'll say, "How do you do?" coldly.... [Takes a snapshot] Keep<br>
        still.... Once more, for the last time.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.585><b>RODE.</b> [Embracing TUZENBACH] We shan't meet again.... [Kisses IRINA'S<br>
        hand] Thank you for everything, for everything!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.586><b>FEDOTIK.</b> [Grieved] Don't be in such a hurry!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.587><b>TUZENBACH.</b> We shall meet again, if God wills it. Write to us. Be sure to<br>
        write.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.588><b>RODE.</b> [Looking round the garden] Good-bye, trees! [Shouts] Yo-ho!<br>
        [Pause] Good-bye, echo!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.589><b>KULIGIN.</b> Best wishes. Go and get yourselves wives there in Poland....<br>
        Your Polish wife will clasp you and call you "kochanku!" [Note:<br>
        Darling.] [Laughs.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.590><b>FEDOTIK.</b> [Looking at the time] There's less than an hour left. Soleni is<br>
        the only one of our battery who is going on the barge; the rest of us<br>
        are going with the main body. Three batteries are leaving to-day,<br>
        another three to-morrow and then the town will be quiet and peaceful.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.591><b>TUZENBACH.</b> And terribly dull.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.592><b>RODE.</b> And where is Maria Sergeyevna?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.593><b>KULIGIN.</b> Masha is in the garden.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.594><b>FEDOTIK.</b> We'd like to say good-bye to her.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.595><b>RODE.</b> Good-bye, I must go, or else I'll start weeping.... [Quickly<br>
        embraces KULIGIN and TUZENBACH, and kisses IRINA'S hand] We've been so<br>
        happy here....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.596><b>FEDOTIK.</b> [To KULIGIN] Here's a keepsake for you... a note-book with a<br>
        pencil.... We'll go to the river from here.... [They go aside and both<br>
        look round.]</a><br>

<p>[At the back of the stage FEDOTIK and RODE meet MASHA; they say good-bye<br>
        and go out with her.]</p>
<a name=1.4.599><b>IRINA.</b> They've gone.... [Sits on the bottom step of the terrace.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.600><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> And they forgot to say good-bye to me.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.601><b>IRINA.</b> But why is that?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.602><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> I just forgot, somehow. Though I'll soon see them again, I'm<br>
        going to-morrow. Yes... just one day left. I shall be retired in a year,<br>
        then I'll come here again, and finish my life near you. I've only one<br>
        year before I get my pension.... [Puts one newspaper into his pocket and<br>
        takes another out] I'll come here to you and change my life radically...<br>
        I'll be so quiet... so agree... agreeable, respectable....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.603><b>IRINA.</b> Yes, you ought to change your life, dear man, somehow or other.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.604><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Yes, I feel it. [Sings softly.] "Tarara-boom-deay...."</a><br>
<a name=1.4.605><b>KULIGIN.</b> We won't reform Ivan Romanovitch! We won't reform him!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.606><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> If only I was apprenticed to you! Then I'd reform.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.607><b>IRINA.</b> Feodor has shaved his moustache! I can't bear to look at him.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.608><b>KULIGIN.</b> Well, what about it?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.609><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> I could tell you what your face looks like now, but it<br>
        wouldn't be polite.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.610><b>KULIGIN.</b> Well! It's the custom, it's modus vivendi. Our Director is<br>
        clean-shaven, and so I too, when I received my inspectorship, had my<br>
        moustaches removed. Nobody likes it, but it's all one to me. I'm<br>
        satisfied. Whether I've got moustaches or not, I'm satisfied.... [Sits.]</a><br>
<p>[At the back of the stage ANDREY is wheeling a perambulator containing a<br>
        sleeping infant.]</p>
<a name=1.4.611><b>IRINA.</b> Ivan Romanovitch, be a darling. I'm awfully worried. You were out<br>
        on the boulevard last night; tell me, what happened?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.612><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> What happened? Nothing. Quite a trifling matter. [Reads<br>
        paper] Of no importance!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.613><b>KULIGIN.</b> They say that Soleni and the Baron met yesterday on the<br>
        boulevard near the theatre....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.614><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Stop! What right... [Waves his hand and goes into the house.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.615><b>KULIGIN.</b> Near the theatre... Soleni started behaving offensively to the<br>
        Baron, who lost his temper and said something nasty....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.616><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> I don't know. It's all bunkum.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.617><b>KULIGIN.</b> At some seminary or other a master wrote "bunkum" on an essay,<br>
        and the student couldn't make the letters out&mdash;thought it was a<br>
        Latin word "luckum." [Laughs] Awfully funny, that. They say that Soleni<br>
        is in love with Irina and hates the Baron.... That's quite natural.<br>
        Irina is a very nice girl. She's even like Masha, she's so<br>
        thoughtful.... Only, Irina your character is gentler. Though Masha's<br>
        character, too, is a very good one. I'm very fond of Masha. [Shouts of<br>
        "Yo-ho!" are heard behind the stage.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.618><b>IRINA.</b> [Shudders] Everything seems to frighten me today. [Pause] I've<br>
        got everything ready, and I send my things off after dinner. The Baron<br>
        and I will be married to-morrow, and to-morrow we go away to the<br>
        brickworks, and the next day I go to the school, and the new life<br>
        begins. God will help me! When I took my examination for the teacher's<br>
        post, I actually wept for joy and gratitude.... [Pause] The cart will be<br>
        here in a minute for my things....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.619><b>KULIGIN.</b> Somehow or other, all this doesn't seem at all serious. As if<br>
        it was all ideas, and nothing really serious. Still, with all my soul I<br>
        wish you happiness.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.620><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [With deep feeling] My splendid... my dear, precious<br>
        girl.... You've gone on far ahead, I won't catch up with you. I'm left<br>
        behind like a migrant bird grown old, and unable to fly. Fly, my dear,<br>
        fly, and God be with you! [Pause] It's a pity you shaved your<br>
        moustaches, Feodor Ilitch.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.621><b>KULIGIN.</b> Oh, drop it! [Sighs] To-day the soldiers will be gone, and<br>
        everything will go on as in the old days. Say what you will, Masha is a<br>
        good, honest woman. I love her very much, and thank my fate for her.<br>
        People have such different fates. There's a Kosirev who works in the<br>
        excise department here. He was at school with me; he was expelled from<br>
        the fifth class of the High School for being entirely unable to<br>
        understandut consecutivum. He's awfully hard up now and in very<br>
        poor health, and when I meet him I say to him, "How do you do,ut<br>
        consecutivum." "Yes," he says, "preciselyconsecutivum..."<br>
        and coughs. But I've been successful all my life, I'm happy, and I even<br>
        have a Stanislaus Cross, of the second class, and now I myself teach<br>
        others thatut consecutivum. Of course, I'm a clever man, much<br>
        cleverer than many, but happiness doesn't only lie in that....</a><br>
<p>["The Maiden's Prayer" is being played on the piano in the house.]</p>
<a name=1.4.622><b>IRINA.</b> To-morrow night I shan't hear that "Maiden's Prayer" any more,<br>
        and I shan't be meeting Protopopov.... [Pause] Protopopov is sitting<br>
        there in the drawing-room; and he came to-day...</a><br>
<a name=1.4.623><b>KULIGIN.</b> Hasn't the head-mistress come yet?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.624><b>IRINA.</b> No. She has been sent for. If you only knew how difficult it is<br>
        for me to live alone, without Olga.... She lives at the High School;<br>
        she, a head-mistress, busy all day with her affairs and I'm alone,<br>
        bored, with nothing to do, and hate the room I live in.... I've made up<br>
        my mind: if I can't live in Moscow, then it must come to this. It's<br>
        fate. It can't be helped. It's all the will of God, that's the truth.<br>
        Nicolai Lvovitch made me a proposal.... Well? I thought it over and made<br>
        up my mind. He's a good man... it's quite remarkable how good he is....<br>
        And suddenly my soul put out wings, I became happy, and light-hearted,<br>
        and once again the desire for work, work, came over me.... Only<br>
        something happened yesterday, some secret dread has been hanging over<br>
        me....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.625><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Luckum. Rubbish.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.626><b>NATASHA.</b> [At the window] The head-mistress.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.627><b>KULIGIN.</b> The head-mistress has come. Let's go. [Exit with IRINA into the<br>
        house.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.628><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> "It is my washing day.... Tara-ra... boom-deay."</a><br>
<p>[MASHA approaches, ANDREY is wheeling a perambulator at the back.]</p>
<a name=1.4.629><b>MASHA.</b> Here you are, sitting here, doing nothing.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.630><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> What then?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.631><b>MASHA.</b> [Sits] Nothing.... [Pause] Did you love my mother?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.632><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Very much.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.633><b>MASHA.</b> And did she love you?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.634><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [After a pause] I don't remember that.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.635><b>MASHA.</b> Is my man here? When our cook Martha used to ask about her<br>
        gendarme, she used to say my man. Is he here?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.636><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Not yet.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.637><b>MASHA.</b> When you take your happiness in little bits, in snatches, and<br>
        then lose it, as I have done, you gradually get coarser, more bitter.<br>
        [Points to her bosom] I'm boiling in here.... [Looks at ANDREY with the<br>
        perambulator] There's our brother Andrey.... All our hopes in him have<br>
        gone. There was once a great bell, a thousand persons were hoisting it,<br>
        much money and labour had been spent on it, when it suddenly fell and<br>
        was broken. Suddenly, for no particular reason.... Andrey is like<br>
        that....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.638><b>ANDREY.</b> When are they going to stop making such a noise in the house?<br>
        It's awful.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.639><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> They won't be much longer. [Looks at his watch] My watch is<br>
        very old-fashioned, it strikes the hours.... [Winds the watch and makes<br>
        it strike] The first, second, and fifth batteries are to leave at one<br>
        o'clock precisely. [Pause] And I go to-morrow.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.640><b>ANDREY.</b> For good?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.641><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> I don't know. Perhaps I'll return in a year. The devil only<br>
        knows... it's all one.... [Somewhere a harp and violin are being<br>
        played.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.642><b>ANDREY.</b> The town will grow empty. It will be as if they put a cover over<br>
        it. [Pause] Something happened yesterday by the theatre. The whole town<br>
        knows of it, but I don't.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.643><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Nothing. A silly little affair. Soleni started irritating<br>
        the Baron, who lost his temper and insulted him, and so at last Soleni<br>
        had to challenge him. [Looks at his watch] It's about time, I think....<br>
        At half-past twelve, in the public wood, that one you can see from here<br>
        across the river.... Piff-paff. [Laughs] Soleni thinks he's Lermontov,<br>
        and even writes verses. That's all very well, but this is his third<br>
        duel.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.644><b>MASHA.</b> Whose?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.645><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Soleni's.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.646><b>MASHA.</b> And the Baron?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.647><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> What about the Baron? [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.648><b>MASHA.</b> Everything's all muddled up in my head.... But I say it ought not<br>
        to be allowed. He might wound the Baron or even kill him.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.649><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> The Baron is a good man, but one Baron more or less&mdash;what<br>
        difference does it make? It's all the same! [Beyond the garden somebody<br>
        shouts "Co-ee! Hallo! "] You wait. That's Skvortsov shouting; one of the<br>
        seconds. He's in a boat. [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.650><b>ANDREY.</b> In my opinion it's simply immoral to fight in a duel, or to be<br>
        present, even in the quality of a doctor.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.651><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> It only seems so.... We don't exist, there's nothing on<br>
        earth, we don't really live, it only seems that we live. Does it matter,<br>
        anyway!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.652><b>MASHA.</b> You talk and talk the whole day long. [Going] You live in a<br>
        climate like this, where it might snow any moment, and there you<br>
        talk.... [Stops] I won't go into the house, I can't go there.... Tell me<br>
        when Vershinin comes.... [Goes along the avenue] The migrant birds are<br>
        already on the wing.... [Looks up] Swans or geese.... My dear, happy<br>
        things.... [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.653><b>ANDREY.</b> Our house will be empty. The officers will go away, you are<br>
        going, my sister is getting married, and I alone will remain in the<br>
        house.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.654><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> And your wife?</a><br>
<p>[FERAPONT enters with some documents.]</p>
<a name=1.4.655><b>ANDREY.</b> A wife's a wife. She's honest, well-bred, yes; and kind, but<br>
        with all that there is still something about her that degenerates her<br>
        into a petty, blind, even in some respects misshapen animal. In any<br>
        case, she isn't a man. I tell you as a friend, as the only man to whom I<br>
        can lay bare my soul. I love Natasha, it's true, but sometimes she seems<br>
        extraordinarily vulgar, and then I lose myself and can't understand why<br>
        I love her so much, or, at any rate, used to love her....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.656><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Rises] I'm going away to-morrow, old chap, and perhaps<br>
        we'll never meet again, so here's my advice. Put on your cap, take a<br>
        stick in your hand, go... go on and on, without looking round. And the<br>
        farther you go, the better.</a><br>
<p>[SOLENI goes across the back of the stage with two officers; he catches<br>
        sight of CHEBUTIKIN, and turns to him, the officers go on.]</p>
<a name=1.4.657><b>SOLENI.</b> Doctor, it's time. It's half-past twelve already. [Shakes hands<br>
        with ANDREY.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.658><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Half a minute. I'm tired of the lot of you. [To ANDREY] If<br>
        anybody asks for me, say I'll be back soon.... [Sighs] Oh, oh, oh!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.659><b>SOLENI.</b> "He didn't have the time to sigh. The bear sat on him heavily."<br>
        [Goes up to him] What are you groaning about, old man?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.660><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Stop it!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.661><b>SOLENI.</b> How's your health?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.662><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Angry] Mind your own business.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.663><b>SOLENI.</b> The old man is unnecessarily excited. I won't go far, I'll only<br>
        just bring him down like a snipe. [Takes out his scent-bottle and scents<br>
        his hands] I've poured out a whole bottle of scent to-day and they still<br>
        smell... of a dead body. [Pause] Yes.... You remember the poem</a><br>
<a name=1.4.664><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Yes.</a><br>
<p>[Exit with SOLENI.]</p>
<p>[Shouts are heard. ANDREY and FERAPONT come in.]</p>
<a name=1.4.665><b>FERAPONT.</b> Documents to sign....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.666><b>ANDREY.</b> [Irritated]. Go away! Leave me! Please! [Goes away with the<br>
        perambulator.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.667><b>FERAPONT.</b> That's what documents are for, to be signed. [Retires to back<br>
        of stage.]</a><br>
<p>[Enter IRINA, with TUZENBACH in a straw hat; KULIGIN walks across the<br>
        stage, shouting "Co-ee, Masha, co-ee!"]</p>
<a name=1.4.668><b>TUZENBACH.</b> He seems to be the only man in the town who is glad that the<br>
        soldiers are going.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.669><b>IRINA.</b> One can understand that. [Pause] The town will be empty.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.670><b>TUZENBACH.</b> My dear, I shall return soon.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.671><b>IRINA.</b> Where are you going?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.672><b>TUZENBACH.</b> I must go into the town and then... see the others off.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.673><b>IRINA.</b> It's not true... Nicolai, why are you so absentminded to-day?<br>
        [Pause] What took place by the theatre yesterday?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.674><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Making a movement of impatience] In an hour's time I shall<br>
        return and be with you again. [Kisses her hands] My darling... [Looking<br>
        her closely in the face] it's five years now since I fell in love with<br>
        you, and still I can't get used to it, and you seem to me to grow more<br>
        and more beautiful. What lovely, wonderful hair! What eyes! I'm going to<br>
        take you away to-morrow. We shall work, we shall be rich, my dreams will<br>
        come true. You will be happy. There's only one thing, one thing only:<br>
        you don't love me!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.675><b>IRINA.</b> It isn't in my power! I shall be your wife, I shall be true to<br>
        you, and obedient to you, but I can't love you. What can I do! [Cries] I<br>
        have never been in love in my life. Oh, I used to think so much of love,<br>
        I have been thinking about it for so long by day and by night, but my<br>
        soul is like an expensive piano which is locked and the key lost.<br>
        [Pause] You seem so unhappy.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.676><b>TUZENBACH.</b> I didn't sleep at night. There is nothing in my life so awful<br>
        as to be able to frighten me, only that lost key torments my soul and<br>
        does not let me sleep. Say something to me [Pause] say something to<br>
        me....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.677><b>IRINA.</b> What can I say, what?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.678><b>TUZENBACH.</b> Anything.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.679><b>IRINA.</b> Don't! don't! [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.680><b>TUZENBACH.</b> It is curious how silly trivial little things, sometimes for<br>
        no apparent reason, become significant. At first you laugh at these<br>
        things, you think they are of no importance, you go on and you feel that<br>
        you haven't got the strength to stop yourself. Oh don't let's talk about<br>
        it! I am happy. It is as if for the first time in my life I see these<br>
        firs, maples, beeches, and they all look at me inquisitively and wait.<br>
        What beautiful trees and how beautiful, when one comes to think of it,<br>
        life must be near them! [A shout of Co-ee! in the distance] It's time I<br>
        went.... There's a tree which has dried up but it still sways in the<br>
        breeze with the others. And so it seems to me that if I die, I shall<br>
        still take part in life in one way or another. Good-bye, dear....<br>
        [Kisses her hands] The papers which you gave me are on my table under<br>
        the calendar.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.681><b>IRINA.</b> I am coming with you.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.682><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Nervously] No, no! [He goes quickly and stops in the avenue]<br>
        Irina!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.683><b>IRINA.</b> What is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.684><b>TUZENBACH.</b> [Not knowing what to say] I haven't had any coffee to-day.<br>
        Tell them to make me some.... [He goes out quickly.]</a><br>
<p>[IRINA stands deep in thought. Then she goes to the back of the stage<br>
        and sits on a swing. ANDREY comes in with the perambulator and FERAPONT<br>
        also appears.]</p>
<a name=1.4.685><b>FERAPONT.</b> Andrey Sergeyevitch, it isn't as if the documents were mine,<br>
        they are the government's. I didn't make them.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.686><b>ANDREY.</b> Oh, what has become of my past and where is it? I used to be<br>
        young, happy, clever, I used to be able to think and frame clever ideas,<br>
        the present and the future seemed to me full of hope. Why do we, almost<br>
        before we have begun to live, become dull, grey, uninteresting, lazy,<br>
        apathetic, useless, unhappy.... This town has already been in existence<br>
        for two hundred years and it has a hundred thousand inhabitants, not one<br>
        of whom is in any way different from the others. There has never been,<br>
        now or at any other time, a single leader of men, a single scholar, an<br>
        artist, a man of even the slightest eminence who might arouse envy or a<br>
        passionate desire to be imitated. They only eat, drink, sleep, and then<br>
        they die... more people are born and also eat, drink, sleep, and so as<br>
        not to go silly from boredom, they try to make life many-sided with<br>
        their beastly backbiting, vodka, cards, and litigation. The wives<br>
        deceive their husbands, and the husbands lie, and pretend they see<br>
        nothing and hear nothing, and the evil influence irresistibly oppresses<br>
        the children and the divine spark in them is extinguished, and they<br>
        become just as pitiful corpses and just as much like one another as<br>
        their fathers and mothers.... [Angrily to FERAPONT] What do you want?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.687><b>FERAPONT.</b> What? Documents want signing.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.688><b>ANDREY.</b> I'm tired of you.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.689><b>FERAPONT.</b> [Handing him papers] The hall-porter from the law courts was<br>
        saying just now that in the winter there were two hundred degrees of<br>
        frost in Petersburg.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.690><b>ANDREY.</b> The present is beastly, but when I think of the future, how good<br>
        it is! I feel so light, so free; there is a light in the distance, I see<br>
        freedom. I see myself and my children freeing ourselves from vanities,<br>
        from kvass, from goose baked with cabbage, from after-dinner naps, from<br>
        base idleness....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.691><b>FERAPONT.</b> He was saying that two thousand people were frozen to death.<br>
        The people were frightened, he said. In Petersburg or Moscow, I don't<br>
        remember which.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.692><b>ANDREY.</b> [Overcome by a tender emotion] My dear sisters, my beautiful<br>
        sisters! [Crying] Masha, my sister....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.693><b>NATASHA.</b> [At the window] Who's talking so loudly out here? Is that you,<br>
        Andrey? You'll wake little Sophie.Il ne faut pas faire du bruit, la<br>
        Sophie est dormÈe deja. Vous Ítes un ours.[Angrily] If you want to<br>
        talk, then give the perambulator and the baby to somebody else.<br>
        Ferapont, take the perambulator!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.694><b>FERAPONT.</b> Yes'm. [Takes the perambulator.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.695><b>ANDREY.</b> [Confused] I'm speaking quietly.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.696><b>NATASHA.</b> [At the window, nursing her boy] Bobby! Naughty Bobby! Bad<br>
        little Bobby!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.697><b>ANDREY.</b> [Looking through the papers] All right, I'll look them over and<br>
        sign if necessary, and you can take them back to the offices....</a><br>
<p>[Goes into house reading papers; FERAPONT takes the perambulator to the<br>
        back of the garden.]</p>
<a name=1.4.698><b>NATASHA.</b> [At the window] Bobby, what's your mother's name? Dear, dear!<br>
        And who's this? That's Aunt Olga. Say to your aunt, "How do you do,<br>
        Olga!"</a><br>
<p>[Two wandering musicians, a man and a girl, are playing on a violin and<br>
        a harp. VERSHININ, OLGA, and ANFISA come out of the house and listen for<br>
        a minute in silence; IRINA comes up to them.]</p>
<a name=1.4.699><b>OLGA.</b> Our garden might be a public thoroughfare, from the way people<br>
        walk and ride across it. Nurse, give those musicians something!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.700><b>ANFISA.</b> [Gives money to the musicians] Go away with God's blessing on<br>
        you. [The musicians bow and go away] A bitter sort of people. You don't<br>
        play on a full stomach. [To IRINA] How do you do, Arisha! [Kisses her]<br>
        Well, little girl, here I am, still alive! Still alive! In the High<br>
        School, together with little Olga, in her official apartments... so the<br>
        Lord has appointed for my old age. Sinful woman that I am, I've never<br>
        lived like that in my life before.... A large flat, government property,<br>
        and I've a whole room and bed to myself. All government property. I wake<br>
        up at nights and, oh God, and Holy Mother, there isn't a happier person<br>
        than I!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.701><b>VERSHININ.</b> [Looks at his watch] We are going soon, Olga Sergeyevna. It's<br>
        time for me to go. [Pause] I wish you every... every.... Where's Maria<br>
        Sergeyevna?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.702><b>IRINA.</b> She's somewhere in the garden. I'll go and look for her.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.703><b>VERSHININ.</b> If you'll be so kind. I haven't time.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.704><b>ANFISA.</b> I'll go and look, too. [Shouts] Little Masha, co-ee! [Goes out<br>
        with IRINA down into the garden] Co-ee, co-ee!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.705><b>VERSHININ.</b> Everything comes to an end. And so we, too, must part. [Looks<br>
        at his watch] The town gave us a sort of farewell breakfast, we had<br>
        champagne to drink and the mayor made a speech, and I ate and listened,<br>
        but my soul was here all the time.... [Looks round the garden] I'm so<br>
        used to you now.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.706><b>OLGA.</b> Shall we ever meet again?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.707><b>VERSHININ.</b> Probably not. [Pause] My wife and both my daughters will stay<br>
        here another two months. If anything happens, or if anything has to be<br>
        done...</a><br>
<a name=1.4.708><b>OLGA.</b> Yes, yes, of course. You need not worry. [Pause] To-morrow there<br>
        won't be a single soldier left in the town, it will all be a memory,<br>
        and, of course, for us a new life will begin.... [Pause] None of our<br>
        plans are coming right. I didn't want to be a head-mistress, but they<br>
        made me one, all the same. It means there's no chance of Moscow....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.709><b>VERSHININ.</b> Well... thank you for everything. Forgive me if I've... I've<br>
        said such an awful lot&mdash;forgive me for that too, don't think badly<br>
        of me.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.710><b>OLGA.</b> [Wipes her eyes] Why isn't Masha coming...</a><br>
<a name=1.4.711><b>VERSHININ.</b> What else can I say in parting? Can I philosophize about<br>
        anything? [Laughs] Life is heavy. To many of us it seems dull and<br>
        hopeless, but still, it must be acknowledged that it is getting lighter<br>
        and clearer, and it seems that the time is not far off when it will be<br>
        quite clear. [Looks at his watch] It's time I went! Mankind used to be<br>
        absorbed in wars, and all its existence was filled with campaigns,<br>
        attacks, defeats, now we've outlived all that, leaving after us a great<br>
        waste place, which there is nothing to fill with at present; but mankind<br>
        is looking for something, and will certainly find it. Oh, if it only<br>
        happened more quickly. [Pause] If only education could be added to<br>
        industry, and industry to education. [Looks at his watch] It's time I<br>
        went....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.712><b>OLGA.</b> Here she comes.</a><br>
<p>[Enter MASHA.]</p>
<a name=1.4.713><b>VERSHININ.</b> I came to say good-bye....</a><br>
<p>[OLGA steps aside a little, so as not to be in their way.]</p>
<a name=1.4.714><b>MASHA.</b> [Looking him in the face] Good-bye. [Prolonged kiss.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.715><b>OLGA.</b> Don't, don't. [MASHA is crying bitterly]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.716><b>VERSHININ.</b> Write to me.... Don't forget! Let me go.... It's time. Take<br>
        her, Olga Sergeyevna... it's time... I'm late...</a><br>
<p>[He kisses OLGA'S hand in evident emotion, then embraces MASHA once more<br>
        and goes out quickly.]</p>
<a name=1.4.717><b>OLGA.</b> Don't, Masha! Stop, dear.... [KULIGIN enters.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.718><b>KULIGIN.</b> [Confused] Never mind, let her cry, let her.... My dear Masha,<br>
        my good Masha.... You're my wife, and I'm happy, whatever happens... I'm<br>
        not complaining, I don't reproach you at all.... Olga is a witness to<br>
        it. Let's begin to live again as we used to, and not by a single word,<br>
        or hint...MASHA. [Restraining her sobs]    "There stands a green oak by the sea,<br>
     And a chain of bright gold is around it....<br>
     And a chain of bright gold is around it...."I'm going off my head... "There stands... a green oak... by the sea."...</a><br>
<a name=1.4.719><b>OLGA.</b> Don't, Masha, don't... give her some water....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.720><b>MASHA.</b> I'm not crying any more....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.721><b>KULIGIN.</b> She's not crying any more... she's a good... [A shot is heard<br>
        from a distance.]MASHA.    "There stands a green oak by the sea,<br>
     And a chain of bright gold is around it...<br>
     An oak of green gold...."I'm mixing it up.... [Drinks some water] Life is dull... I don't want<br>
        anything more now... I'll be all right in a moment.... It doesn't<br>
        matter.... What do those lines mean? Why do they run in my head? My<br>
        thoughts are all tangled.</a><br>
<p>[IRINA enters.]</p>
<a name=1.4.722><b>OLGA.</b> Be quiet, Masha. There's a good girl.... Let's go in.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.723><b>MASHA.</b> [Angrily] I shan't go in there. [Sobs, but controls herself at<br>
        once] I'm not going to go into the house, I won't go....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.724><b>IRINA.</b> Let's sit here together and say nothing. I'm going away<br>
        to-morrow.... [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.725><b>KULIGIN.</b> Yesterday I took away these whiskers and this beard from a boy<br>
        in the third class.... [He puts on the whiskers and beard] Don't I look<br>
        like the German master.... [Laughs] Don't I? The boys are amusing.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.726><b>MASHA.</b> You really do look like that German of yours.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.727><b>OLGA.</b> [Laughs] Yes. [MASHA weeps.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.728><b>IRINA.</b> Don't, Masha!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.729><b>KULIGIN.</b> It's a very good likeness....</a><br>
<p>[Enter NATASHA.]</p>
<a name=1.4.730><b>NATASHA.</b> [To the maid] What? Mihail Ivanitch Protopopov will sit with<br>
        little Sophie, and Andrey Sergeyevitch can take little Bobby out.<br>
        Children are such a bother.... [To IRINA] Irina, it's such a pity you're<br>
        going away to-morrow. Do stop just another week. [Sees KULIGIN and<br>
        screams; he laughs and takes off his beard and whiskers] How you<br>
        frightened me! [To IRINA] I've grown used to you and do you think it<br>
        will be easy for me to part from you? I'm going to have Andrey and his<br>
        violin put into your room&mdash;let him fiddle away in there!&mdash;and<br>
        we'll put little Sophie into his room. The beautiful, lovely child! What<br>
        a little girlie! To-day she looked at me with such pretty eyes and said<br>
        "Mamma!"</a><br>
<a name=1.4.731><b>KULIGIN.</b> A beautiful child, it's quite true.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.732><b>NATASHA.</b> That means I shall have the place to myself to-morrow. [Sighs]<br>
        In the first place I shall have that avenue of fir-trees cut down, then<br>
        that maple. It's so ugly at nights.... [To IRINA] That belt doesn't suit<br>
        you at all, dear.... It's an error of taste. And I'll give orders to<br>
        have lots and lots of little flowers planted here, and they'll smell....<br>
        [Severely] Why is there a fork lying about here on the seat? [Going<br>
        towards the house, to the maid] Why is there a fork lying about here on<br>
        the seat, I say? [Shouts] Don't you dare to answer me!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.733><b>KULIGIN.</b> Temper! temper! [A march is played off; they all listen.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.734><b>OLGA.</b> They're going.</a><br>
<p>[CHEBUTIKIN comes in.]</p>
<a name=1.4.735><b>MASHA.</b> They're going. Well, well.... Bon voyage! [To her husband] We<br>
        must be going home.... Where's my coat and hat?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.736><b>KULIGIN.</b> I took them in... I'll bring them, in a moment.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.737><b>OLGA.</b> Yes, now we can all go home. It's time.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.738><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Olga Sergeyevna!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.739><b>OLGA.</b> What is it? [Pause] What is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.740><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Nothing... I don't know how to tell you.... [Whispers to<br>
        her.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.741><b>OLGA.</b> [Frightened] It can't be true!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.742><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> Yes... such a story... I'm tired out, exhausted, I won't say<br>
        any more.... [Sadly] Still, it's all the same!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.743><b>MASHA.</b> What's happened?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.744><b>OLGA.</b> [Embraces IRINA] This is a terrible day... I don't know how to<br>
        tell you, dear....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.745><b>IRINA.</b> What is it? Tell me quickly, what is it? For God's sake! [Cries.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.746><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> The Baron was killed in the duel just now.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.747><b>IRINA.</b> [Cries softly] I knew it, I knew it....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.748><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Sits on a bench at the back of the stage] I'm tired....<br>
        [Takes a paper from his pocket] Let 'em cry.... [Sings softly]<br>
        "Tarara-boom-deay, it is my washing day...." Isn't it all the same!</a><br>
<p>[The three sisters are standing, pressing against one another.]</p>
<a name=1.4.749><b>MASHA.</b> Oh, how the music plays! They are leaving us, one has quite left<br>
        us, quite and for ever. We remain alone, to begin our life over again.<br>
        We must live... we must live....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.750><b>IRINA.</b> [Puts her head on OLGA's bosom] There will come a time when<br>
        everybody will know why, for what purpose, there is all this suffering,<br>
        and there will be no more mysteries. But now we must live... we must<br>
        work, just work! To-morrow, I'll go away alone, and I'll teach and give<br>
        my whole life to those who, perhaps, need it. It's autumn now, soon it<br>
        will be winter, the snow will cover everything, and I shall be working,<br>
        working....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.751><b>OLGA.</b> [Embraces both her sisters] The bands are playing so gaily, so<br>
        bravely, and one does so want to live! Oh, my God! Time will pass on,<br>
        and we shall depart for ever, we shall be forgotten; they will forget<br>
        our faces, voices, and even how many there were of us, but our<br>
        sufferings will turn into joy for those who will live after us,<br>
        happiness and peace will reign on earth, and people will remember with<br>
        kindly words, and bless those who are living now. Oh dear sisters, our<br>
        life is not yet at an end. Let us live. The music is so gay, so joyful,<br>
        and, it seems that in a little while we shall know why we are living,<br>
        why we are suffering.... If we could only know, if we could only know!</a><br>
<p>[The music has been growing softer and softer; KULIGIN, smiling happily,<br>
        brings out the hat and coat; ANDREY wheels out the perambulator in which<br>
        BOBBY is sitting.]</p>
<a name=1.4.752><b>CHEBUTIKIN.</b> [Sings softly] "Tara... ra-boom-deay.... It is my<br>
        washing-day."... [Reads a paper] It's all the same! It's all the same!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.753><b>OLGA.</b> If only we could know, if only we could know!</a><br>
<p>Curtain.</p>
