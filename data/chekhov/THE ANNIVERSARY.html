<h2>THE ANNIVERSARY</h2>
<p>The action takes place at the Bank</p>
<p>[The private office of the Chairman of Directors. On the left is a door,<br>
        leading into the public department. There are two desks. The furniture<br>
        aims at a deliberately luxurious effect, with armchairs covered in<br>
        velvet, flowers, statues, carpets, and a telephone. It is midday. KHIRIN<br>
        is alone; he wears long felt boots, and is shouting through the door.]</p>
<a name=1.1.1><b>KHIRIN.</b> Send out to the chemist for 15 copecks' worth of valerian drops,<br>
        and tell them to bring some drinking water into the Directors' office!<br>
        This is the hundredth time I've asked! [Goes to a desk] I'm absolutely<br>
        tired out. This is the fourth day I've been working, without a chance of<br>
        shutting my eyes. From morning to evening I work here, from evening to<br>
        morning at home. [Coughs] And I've got an inflammation all over me. I'm<br>
        hot and cold, and I cough, and my legs ache, and there's something<br>
        dancing before my eyes. [Sits] Our scoundrel of a Chairman, the brute,<br>
        is going to read a report at a general meeting. "Our Bank, its Present<br>
        and Future." You'd think he was a Gambetta.... [At work] Two... one...<br>
        one... six... nought... seven.... Next, six... nought... one... six....<br>
        He just wants to throw dust into people's eyes, and so I sit here and<br>
        work for him like a galley-slave! This report of his is poetic fiction<br>
        and nothing more, and here I've got to sit day after day and add<br>
        figures, devil take his soul! [Rattles on his counting-frame] I can't<br>
        stand it! [Writing] That is, one... three... seven... two... one...<br>
        nought.... He promised to reward me for my work. If everything goes well<br>
        to-day and the public is properly put into blinkers, he's promised me a<br>
        gold charm and 300 roubles bonus.... We'll see. [Works] Yes, but if my<br>
        work all goes for nothing, then you'd better look out.... I'm very<br>
        excitable.... If I lose my temper I'm capable of committing some crime,<br>
        so look out! Yes!</a><br>
<p>[Noise and applause behind the scenes. SHIPUCHIN'S voice: "Thank you!<br>
        Thank you! I am extremely grateful." Enter SHIPUCHIN. He wears a<br>
        frockcoat and white tie; he carries an album which has been just<br>
        presented to him.]</p>
<a name=1.1.2><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [At the door, addresses the outer office] This present, my<br>
        dear colleagues, will be preserved to the day of my death, as a memory<br>
        of the happiest days of my life! Yes, gentlemen! Once more, I thank you!<br>
        [Throws a kiss into the air and turns to KHIRIN] My dear, my respected<br>
        Kusma Nicolaievitch!</a><br>
<p>[All the time that SHIPUCHIN is on the stage, clerks intermittently come<br>
        in with papers for his signature and go out.]</p>
<a name=1.1.3><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Standing up] I have the honour to congratulate you, Andrey<br>
        Andreyevitch, on the fiftieth anniversary of our Bank, and hope that...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.4><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Warmly shakes hands] Thank you, my dear sir! Thank you! I<br>
        think that in view of the unique character of the day, as it is an<br>
        anniversary, we may kiss each other!... [They kiss] I am very, very<br>
        glad! Thank you for your service... for everything! If, in the course of<br>
        the time during which I have had the honour to be Chairman of this Bank<br>
        anything useful has been done, the credit is due, more than to anybody<br>
        else, to my colleagues. [Sighs] Yes, fifteen years! Fifteen years as my<br>
        name's Shipuchin! [Changes his tone] Where's my report? Is it getting<br>
        on?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.5><b>KHIRIN.</b> Yes; there's only five pages left.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.6><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Excellent. Then it will be ready by three?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.7><b>KHIRIN.</b> If nothing occurs to disturb me, I'll get it done. Nothing of<br>
        any importance is now left.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.8><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Splendid. Splendid, as my name's Shipuchin! The general<br>
        meeting will be at four. If you please, my dear fellow. Give me the<br>
        first half, I'll peruse it.... Quick.... [Takes the report] I base<br>
        enormous hopes on this report. It's myprofession de foi, or,<br>
        better still, my firework. [Note: The actual word employed.] My<br>
        firework, as my name's Shipuchin! [Sits and reads the report to himself]<br>
        I'm hellishly tired.... My gout kept on giving me trouble last night,<br>
        all the morning I was running about, and then these excitements,<br>
        ovations, agitations... I'm tired!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.9><b>KHIRIN.</b> Two... nought... nought... three... nine... two... nought. I<br>
        can't see straight after all these figures.... Three... one... six...<br>
        four... one... five.... [Uses the counting-frame.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.10><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Another unpleasantness.... This morning your wife came to see<br>
        me and complained about you once again. Said that last night you<br>
        threatened her and her sister with a knife. Kusma Nicolaievitch, what do<br>
        you mean by that? Oh, oh!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.11><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Rudely] As it's an anniversary, Andrey Andreyevitch, I'll ask<br>
        for a special favour. Please, even if it's only out of respect for my<br>
        toil, don't interfere in my family life. Please!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.12><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Sighs] Yours is an impossible character, Kusma<br>
        Nicolaievitch! You're an excellent and respected man, but you behave to<br>
        women like some scoundrel. Yes, really. I don't understand why you hate<br>
        them so?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.13><b>KHIRIN.</b> I wish I could understand why you love them so! [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.14><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> The employees have just presented me with an album; and the<br>
        Directors, as I've heard, are going to give me an address and a silver<br>
        loving-cup.... [Playing with his monocle] Very nice, as my name's<br>
        Shipuchin! It isn't excessive. A certain pomp is essential to the<br>
        reputation of the Bank, devil take it! You know everything, of<br>
        course.... I composed the address myself, and I bought the cup myself,<br>
        too.... Well, then there was 45 roubles for the cover of the address,<br>
        but you can't do without that. They'd never have thought of it for<br>
        themselves. [Looks round] Look at the furniture! Just look at it! They<br>
        say I'm stingy, that all I want is that the locks on the doors should be<br>
        polished, that the employees should wear fashionable ties, and that a<br>
        fat hall-porter should stand by the door. No, no, sirs. Polished locks<br>
        and a fat porter mean a good deal. I can behave as I like at home, eat<br>
        and sleep like a pig, get drunk....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.15><b>KHIRIN.</b> Please don't make hints.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.16><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Nobody's making hints! What an impossible character yours<br>
        is.... As I was saying, at home I can live like a tradesman, aparvenu,<br>
        and be up to any games I like, but here everything must been grand.<br>
        This is a Bank! Here every detail mustimponiren, so to speak,<br>
        and have a majestic appearance. [He picks up a paper from the floor and<br>
        throws it into the fireplace] My service to the Bank has been just this&mdash;I've<br>
        raised its reputation. A thing of immense importance is tone! Immense,<br>
        as my name's Shipuchin! [Looks over KHIRIN] My dear man, a deputation of<br>
        shareholders may come here any moment, and there you are in felt boots,<br>
        wearing a scarf... in some absurdly coloured jacket.... You might have<br>
        put on a frock-coat, or at any rate a dark jacket....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.17><b>KHIRIN.</b> My health matters more to me than your shareholders. I've an<br>
        inflammation all over me.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.18><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Excitedly] But you will admit that it's untidy! You spoil<br>
        theensemble!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.19><b>KHIRIN.</b> If the deputation comes I can go and hide myself. It won't<br>
        matter if... seven... one... seven... two... one... five... nought. I<br>
        don't like untidiness myself.... Seven... two... nine... [Uses the<br>
        counting-frame] I can't stand untidiness! It would have been wiser of<br>
        you not to have invited ladies to to-day's anniversary dinner....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.20><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Oh, that's nothing.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.21><b>KHIRIN.</b> I know that you're going to have the hall filled with them<br>
        to-night to make a good show, but you look out, or they'll spoil<br>
        everything. They cause all sorts of mischief and disorder.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.22><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> On the contrary, feminine society elevates!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.23><b>KHIRIN.</b> Yes.... Your wife seems intelligent, but on the Monday of last<br>
        week she let something off that upset me for two days. In front of a lot<br>
        of people she suddenly asks: "Is it true that at our Bank my husband<br>
        bought up a lot of the shares of the Driazhsky-Priazhsky Bank, which<br>
        have been falling on exchange? My husband is so annoyed about it!" This<br>
        in front of people. Why do you tell them everything, I don't understand.<br>
        Do you want them to get you into serious trouble?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.24><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Well, that's enough, enough! All that's too dull for an<br>
        anniversary. Which reminds me, by the way. [Looks at the time] My wife<br>
        ought to be here soon. I really ought to have gone to the station, to<br>
        meet the poor little thing, but there's no time.... and I'm tired. I<br>
        must say I'm not glad of her! That is to say, I am glad, but I'd be<br>
        gladder if she only stayed another couple of days with her mother.<br>
        She'll want me to spend the whole evening with her to-night, whereas we<br>
        have arranged a little excursion for ourselves.... [Shivers] Oh, my<br>
        nerves have already started dancing me about. They are so strained that<br>
        I think the very smallest trifle would be enough to make me break into<br>
        tears! No, I must be strong, as my name's Shipuchin!</a><br>
<p>[Enter TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA SHIPUCHIN in a waterproof, with a little<br>
        travelling satchel slung across her shoulder.]</p>
<a name=1.1.25><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Ah! In the nick of time!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.26><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> Darling!</a><br>
<p>[Runs to her husband: a prolonged kiss.]</p>
<a name=1.1.27><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> We were only speaking of you just now! [Looks at his watch.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.28><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [Panting] Were you very dull without me? Are you<br>
        well? I haven't been home yet, I came here straight from the station.<br>
        I've a lot, a lot to tell you.... I couldn't wait.... I shan't take off<br>
        my clothes, I'll only stay a minute. [To KHIRIN] Good morning, Kusma<br>
        Nicolaievitch! [To her husband] Is everything all right at home?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.29><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Yes, quite. And, you know, you've got to look plumper and<br>
        better this week.... Well, what sort of a time did you have?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.30><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> Splendid. Mamma and Katya send their regards.<br>
        Vassili Andreitch sends you a kiss. [Kisses him] Aunt sends you a jar of<br>
        jam, and is annoyed because you don't write. Zina sends you a kiss.<br>
        [Kisses.] Oh, if you knew what's happened. If you only knew! I'm even<br>
        frightened to tell you! Oh, if you only knew! But I see by your eyes<br>
        that you're sorry I came!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.31><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> On the contrary.... Darling.... [Kisses her.]</a><br>
<p>[KHIRIN coughs angrily.]</p>
<a name=1.1.32><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> Oh, poor Katya, poor Katya! I'm so sorry for her, so<br>
        sorry for her.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.33><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> This is the Bank's anniversary to-day, darling, we may get a<br>
        deputation of the shareholders at any moment, and you're not dressed.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.34><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> Oh, yes, the anniversary! I congratulate you,<br>
        gentlemen. I wish you.... So it means that to-day's the day of the<br>
        meeting, the dinner.... That's good. And do you remember that beautiful<br>
        address which you spent such a long time composing for the shareholders?<br>
        Will it be read to-day?</a><br>
<p>[KHIRIN coughs angrily.]</p>
<a name=1.1.35><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Confused] My dear, we don't talk about these things. You'd<br>
        really better go home.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.36><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> In a minute, in a minute. I'll tell you everything<br>
        in one minute and go. I'll tell you from the very beginning. Well....<br>
        When you were seeing me off, you remember I was sitting next to that<br>
        stout lady, and I began to read. I don't like to talk in the train. I<br>
        read for three stations and didn't say a word to anyone.... Well, then<br>
        the evening set in, and I felt so mournful, you know, with such sad<br>
        thoughts! A young man was sitting opposite me&mdash;not a bad-looking<br>
        fellow, a brunette.... Well, we fell into conversation.... A sailor came<br>
        along then, then some student or other.... [Laughs] I told them that I<br>
        wasn't married... and they did look after me! We chattered till<br>
        midnight, the brunette kept on telling the most awfully funny stories,<br>
        and the sailor kept on singing. My chest began to ache from laughing.<br>
        And when the sailor&mdash;oh, those sailors!&mdash;when he got to know<br>
        my name was TATIANA, you know what he sang? [Sings in a bass voice]<br>
        "Onegin don't let me conceal it, I love Tatiana madly!" [Note: From the<br>
        OperaEvgeni Onegin&mdash;words by Pushkin.] [Roars with<br>
        laughter.]</a><br>
<p>[KHIRIN coughs angrily.]</p>
<a name=1.1.37><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Tania, dear, you're disturbing Kusma Nicolaievitch. Go home,<br>
        dear.... Later on....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.38><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> No, no, let him hear if he wants to, it's awfully<br>
        interesting. I'll end in a minute. Serezha came to meet me at the<br>
        station. Some young man or other turns up, an inspector of taxes, I<br>
        think... quite handsome, especially his eyes.... Serezha introduced me,<br>
        and the three of us rode off together.... It was lovely weather....</a><br>
<p>[Voices behind the stage: "You can't, you can't! What do you want?"<br>
        Enter MERCHUTKINA, waving her arms about.]</p>
<a name=1.1.39><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> What are you dragging at me for. What else! I want him<br>
        himself! [To SHIPUCHIN] I have the honour, your excellency... I am the<br>
        wife of a civil servant, Nastasya Fyodorovna Merchutkina.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.40><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> What do you want?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.41><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Well, you see, your excellency, my husband has been ill for<br>
        five months, and while he was at home, getting better, he was suddenly<br>
        dismissed for no reason, your excellency, and when I went to get his<br>
        salary, they, you see, deducted 24 roubles 36 copecks from it. What for?<br>
        I ask. They said, "Well, he drew it from the employees' account, and the<br>
        others had to make it up." How can that be? How could he draw anything<br>
        without my permission? No, your excellency! I'm a poor woman... my<br>
        lodgers are all I have to live on.... I'm weak and defenceless....<br>
        Everybody does me some harm, and nobody has a kind word for me.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.42><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Excuse me. [Takes a petition from her and reads it standing.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.43><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [To KHIRIN] Yes, but first we.... Last week I<br>
        suddenly received a letter from my mother. She writes that a certain<br>
        Grendilevsky has proposed to my sister Katya. A nice, modest, young man,<br>
        but with no means of his own, and no assured position. And,<br>
        unfortunately, just think of it, Katya is absolutely gone on him. What's<br>
        to be done? Mamma writes telling me to come at once and influence<br>
        Katya....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.44><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Angrily] Excuse me, you've made me lose my place! You go<br>
        talking about your mamma and Katya, and I understand nothing; and I've<br>
        lost my place.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.45><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> What does that matter? You listen when a lady is<br>
        talking to you! Why are you so angry to-day? Are you in love? [Laughs.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.46><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [To MERCHUTKINA] Excuse me, but what is this? I can't make<br>
        head or tail of it.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.47><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> Are you in love? Aha! You're blushing!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.48><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [To his wife] Tanya, dear, do go out into the public office<br>
        for a moment. I shan't be long.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.49><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> All right. [Goes out.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.50><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> I don't understand anything of this. You've obviously come to<br>
        the wrong place, madam. Your petition doesn't concern us at all. You<br>
        should go to the department in which your husband was employed.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.51><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> I've been there a good many times these five months, and<br>
        they wouldn't even look at my petition. I'd given up all hopes, but,<br>
        thanks to my son-in-law, Boris Matveyitch, I thought of coming to you.<br>
        "You go, mother," he says, "and apply to Mr. Shipuchin, he's an<br>
        influential man and can do anything." Help me, your excellency!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.52><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> We can't do anything for you, Mrs. Merchutkina. You must<br>
        understand that your husband, so far as I can gather, was in the employ<br>
        of the Army Medical Department, while this is a private, commercial<br>
        concern, a bank. Don't you understand that?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.53><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Your excellency, I can produce a doctor's certificate of my<br>
        husband's illness. Here it is, just look at it....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.54><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Irritated] That's all right; I quite believe you, but it's<br>
        not our business. [Behind the scene, TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA'S laughter is<br>
        heard, then a man's. SHIPUCHIN glances at the door] She's disturbing the<br>
        employees. [To MERCHUTKINA] It's strange and it's even silly. Surely<br>
        your husband knows where you ought to apply?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.55><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Your excellency, I don't let him know anything. He just<br>
        cried out: "It isn't your business! Get out of this!" And...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.56><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Madam, I repeat, your husband was in the employ of the Army<br>
        Medical Department, and this is a bank, a private, commercial concern.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.57><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Yes, yes, yes.... I understand, my dear. In that case, your<br>
        excellency, just order them to pay me 15 roubles! I don't mind taking<br>
        that to be going on with.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.58><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Sighs] Ouf!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.59><b>KHIRIN.</b> Andrey Andreyevitch, I'll never finish the report at this rate!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.60><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> One moment. [To MERCHUTKINA] I can't get any sense out of<br>
        you. But do understand that your taking this business here is as absurd<br>
        as if you took a divorce petition to a chemist's or into a gold assay<br>
        office. [Knock at the door. The voice of TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA is heard,<br>
        "Can I come in, Andrey?" SHIPUCHIN shouts] Just wait one minute, dear!<br>
        [To MERCHUTKINA] What has it got to do with us if you haven't been paid?<br>
        As it happens, madam, this is an anniversary to-day, we're busy... and<br>
        somebody may be coming here at any moment.... Excuse me....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.61><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Your excellency, have pity on me, an orphan! I'm a weak,<br>
        defenceless woman.... I'm tired to death.... I'm having trouble with my<br>
        lodgers, and on account of my husband, and I've got the house to look<br>
        after, and my son-in-law is out of work....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.62><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Mrs. Merchutkina, I... No, excuse me, I can't talk to you! My<br>
        head's even in a whirl.... You are disturbing us and making us waste our<br>
        time. [Sighs, aside] What a business, as my name's Shipuchin! [To<br>
        KHIRIN] Kusma Nicolaievitch, will you please explain to Mrs.<br>
        Merchutkina. [Waves his hand and goes out into public department.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.63><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Approaching MERCHUTKINA, angrily] What do you want?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.64><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> I'm a weak, defenceless woman.... I may look all right, but<br>
        if you were to take me to pieces you wouldn't find a single healthy bit<br>
        in me! I can hardly stand on my legs, and I've lost my appetite. I drank<br>
        my coffee to-day and got no pleasure out of it.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.65><b>KHIRIN.</b> I ask you, what do you want?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.66><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Tell them, my dear, to give me 15 roubles, and a month<br>
        later will do for the rest.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.67><b>KHIRIN.</b> But haven't you been told perfectly plainly that this is a bank!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.68><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Yes, yes.... And if you like I can show you the doctor's<br>
        certificate.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.69><b>KHIRIN.</b> Have you got a head on your shoulders, or what?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.70><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> My dear, I'm asking for what's mine by law. I don't want<br>
        what isn't mine.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.71><b>KHIRIN.</b> I ask you, madam, have you got a head on your shoulders, or<br>
        what? Well, devil take me, I haven't any time to talk to you! I'm<br>
        busy.... [Points to the door] That way, please!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.72><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> [Surprised] And where's the money?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.73><b>KHIRIN.</b> You haven't a head, but this [Taps the table and then points to<br>
        his forehead.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.74><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> [Offended] What? Well, never mind, never mind.... You can<br>
        do that to your own wife, but I'm the wife of a civil servant.... You<br>
        can't do that to me!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.75><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Losing his temper] Get out of this!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.76><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> No, no, no... none of that!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.77><b>KHIRIN.</b> If you don't get out this second, I'll call for the hall-porter!<br>
        Get out! [Stamping.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.78><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Never mind, never mind! I'm not afraid! I've seen the like<br>
        of you before! Miser!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.79><b>KHIRIN.</b> I don't think I've ever seen a more awful woman in my life....<br>
        Ouf! It's given me a headache.... [Breathing heavily] I tell you once<br>
        more... do you hear me? If you don't get out of this, you old devil,<br>
        I'll grind you into powder! I've got such a character that I'm perfectly<br>
        capable of laming you for life! I can commit a crime!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.80><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> I've heard barking dogs before. I'm not afraid. I've seen<br>
        the like of you before.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.81><b>KHIRIN.</b> [In despair] I can't stand it! I'm ill! I can't! [Sits down at<br>
        his desk] They've let the Bank get filled with women, and I can't finish<br>
        my report! I can't.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.82><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> I don't want anybody else's money, but my own, according to<br>
        law. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Sitting in a government office<br>
        in felt boots....</a><br>
<p>[Enter SHIPUCHIN and TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.]</p>
<a name=1.1.83><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [Following her husband] We spent the evening at the<br>
        Berezhnitskys. Katya was wearing a sky-blue frock of foulard silk, cut<br>
        low at the neck.... She looks very well with her hair done over her<br>
        head, and I did her hair myself.... She was perfectly fascinating....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.84><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Who has had enough of it already] Yes, yes...<br>
        fascinating.... They may be here any moment....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.85><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Your excellency!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.86><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Dully] What else? What do you want?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.87><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Your excellency! [Points to KHIRIN] This man... this man<br>
        tapped the table with his finger, and then his head.... You told him to<br>
        look after my affair, but he insults me and says all sorts of things.<br>
        I'm a weak, defenceless woman....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.88><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> All right, madam, I'll see to it... and take the necessary<br>
        steps.... Go away now... later on! [Aside] My gout's coming on!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.89><b>KHIRIN.</b> [In a low tone to SHIPUCHIN] Andrey Andreyevitch, send for the<br>
        hall-porter and have her turned out neck and crop! What else can we do?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.90><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Frightened] No, no! She'll kick up a row and we aren't the<br>
        only people in the building.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.91><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Your excellency.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.92><b>KHIRIN.</b> [In a tearful voice] But I've got to finish my report! I won't<br>
        have time! I won't!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.93><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Your excellency, when shall I have the money? I want it<br>
        now.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.94><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Aside, in dismay] A re-mark-ab-ly beastly woman! [Politely]<br>
        Madam, I've already told you, this is a bank, a private, commercial<br>
        concern.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.95><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Be a father to me, your excellency.... If the doctor's<br>
        certificate isn't enough, I can get you another from the police. Tell<br>
        them to give me the money!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.96><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Panting] Ouf!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.97><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [To MERCHUTKINA] Mother, haven't you already been<br>
        told that you're disturbing them? What right have you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.98><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Mother, beautiful one, nobody will help me. All I do is to<br>
        eat and drink, and just now I didn't enjoy my coffee at all.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.99><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Exhausted] How much do you want?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.100><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> 24 roubles 36 copecks.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.101><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> All right! [Takes a 25-rouble note out of his pocket-book and<br>
        gives it to her] Here are 25 roubles. Take it and... go!</a><br>
<p>[KHIRIN coughs angrily.]</p>
<a name=1.1.102><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> I thank you very humbly, your excellency. [Hides the<br>
        money.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.103><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [Sits by her husband] It's time I went home....<br>
        [Looks at watch] But I haven't done yet.... I'll finish in one minute<br>
        and go away.... What a time we had! Yes, what a time! We went to spend<br>
        the evening at the Berezhnitskys.... It was all right, quite fun, but<br>
        nothing in particular.... Katya's devoted Grendilevsky was there, of<br>
        course.... Well, I talked to Katya, cried, and induced her to talk to<br>
        Grendilevsky and refuse him. Well, I thought, everything's, settled the<br>
        best possible way; I've quieted mamma down, saved Katya, and can be<br>
        quiet myself.... What do you think? Katya and I were going along the<br>
        avenue, just before supper, and suddenly... [Excitedly] And suddenly we<br>
        heard a shot.... No, I can't talk about it calmly! [Waves her<br>
        handkerchief] No, I can't!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.104><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Sighs] Ouf!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.105><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [Weeps] We ran to the summer-house, and there...<br>
        there poor Grendilevsky was lying... with a pistol in his hand....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.106><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> No, I can't stand this! I can't stand it! [To MERCHUTKINA]<br>
        What else do you want?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.107><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Your excellency, can't my husband go back to his job?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.108><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [Weeping] He'd shot himself right in the heart...<br>
        here.... And the poor man had fallen down senseless.... And he was<br>
        awfully frightened, as he lay there... and asked for a doctor. A doctor<br>
        came soon... and saved the unhappy man....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.109><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Your excellency, can't my husband go back to his job?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.110><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> No, I can't stand this! [Weeps] I can't stand it! [Stretches<br>
        out both his hands in despair to KHIRIN] Drive her away! Drive her away,<br>
        I implore you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.111><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Goes up to TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA] Get out of this!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.112><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Not her, but this one... this awful woman.... [Points] That<br>
        one!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.113><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Not understanding, to TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA] Get out of this!<br>
        [Stamps] Get out!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.114><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> What? What are you doing? Have you taken leave of<br>
        your senses?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.115><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> It's awful? I'm a miserable man! Drive her out! Out with her!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.116><b>KHIRIN.</b> [To TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA] Out of it! I'll cripple you! I'll knock<br>
        you out of shape! I'll break the law!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.117><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [Running from him; he chases her] How dare you! You<br>
        impudent fellow! [Shouts] Andrey! Help! Andrey! [Screams.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.118><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Chasing them] Stop! I implore you! Not such a noise? Have<br>
        pity on me!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.119><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Chasing MERCHUTKINA] Out of this! Catch her! Hit her! Cut her<br>
        into pieces!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.120><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> [Shouts] Stop! I ask you! I implore you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.121><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Little fathers... little fathers! [Screams] Little<br>
        fathers!...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.122><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [Shouts] Help! Help!... Oh, oh... I'm sick, I'm<br>
        sick! [Jumps on to a chair, then falls on to the sofa and groans as if<br>
        in a faint.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.123><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Chasing MERCHUTKINA] Hit her! Beat her! Cut her to pieces!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.124><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> Oh, oh... little fathers, it's all dark before me! Ah!<br>
        [Falls senseless into SHIPUCHIN'S arms. There is a knock at the door; a<br>
        VOICE announces THE DEPUTATION] The deputation... reputation...<br>
        occupation...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.125><b>KHIRIN.</b> [Stamps] Get out of it, devil take me! [Turns up his sleeves]<br>
        Give her to me: I may break the law!</a><br>
<p>[A deputation of five men enters; they all wear frockcoats. One carries<br>
        the velvet-covered address, another, the loving-cup. Employees look in<br>
        at the door, from the public department. TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA on the sofa,<br>
        and MERCHUTKINA in SHIPUCHIN'S arms are both groaning.]</p>
<a name=1.1.126><b>ONE OF THE DEPUTATION.</b> [Reads aloud] "Deeply respected and dear Andrey<br>
        Andreyevitch! Throwing a retrospective glance at the past history of our<br>
        financial administration, and reviewing in our minds its gradual<br>
        development, we receive an extremely satisfactory impression. It is true<br>
        that in the first period of its existence, the inconsiderable amount of<br>
        its capital, and the absence of serious operations of any description,<br>
        and also the indefinite aims of this bank, made us attach an extreme<br>
        importance to the question raised by Hamlet, 'To be or not to be,' and<br>
        at one time there were even voices to be heard demanding our<br>
        liquidation. But at that moment you become the head of our concern. Your<br>
        knowledge, energies, and your native tact were the causes of<br>
        extraordinary success and widespread extension. The reputation of the<br>
        bank... [Coughs] reputation of the bank..."</a><br>
<a name=1.1.127><b>MERCHUTKINA.</b> [Groans] Oh! Oh!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.128><b>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</b> [Groans] Water! Water!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.129><b>THE MEMBER OF THE DEPUTATION.</b> [Continues] The reputation [Coughs]... the<br>
        reputation of the bank has been raised by you to such a height that we<br>
        are now the rivals of the best foreign concerns.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.130><b>SHIPUCHIN.</b> Deputation... reputation... occupation.... Two friends that<br>
        had a walk at night, held converse by the pale moonlight.... Oh tell me<br>
        not, that youth is vain, that jealousy has turned my brain.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.131><b>THE MEMBER OF THE DEPUTATION.</b> [Continues in confusion] "Then, throwing<br>
        an objective glance at the present condition of things, we, deeply<br>
        respected and dear Andrey Andreyevitch... [Lowering his voice] In that<br>
        case, we'll do it later on.... Yes, later on...." [DEPUTATION goes out<br>
