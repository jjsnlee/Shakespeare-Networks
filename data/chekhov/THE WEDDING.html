<h2>THE WEDDING</h2>
<p>The scene is laid in one of the rooms of Andronov's Restaurant</p>
<p>[A brilliantly illuminated room. A large table, laid for supper. Waiters<br>
        in dress-jackets are fussing round the table. An orchestra behind the<br>
        scene is playing the music of the last figure of a quadrille.]</p>
<p>[ANNA MARTINOVNA ZMEYUKINA, YATS, and a GROOMSMAN cross the stage.]</p>
<a name=1.1.1><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> No, no, no!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.2><b>YATS.</b> [Following her] Have pity on us! Have pity!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.3><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> No, no, no!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.4><b>GROOMSMAN.</b> [Chasing them] You can't go on like this! Where are you off<br>
        to? What about thegrand ronde? Grand ronde, s'il vous plait!<br>
        [They all go off.]</a><br>
<p>[Enter NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA and APLOMBOV.]</p>
<a name=1.1.5><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> You had much better be dancing than upsetting me<br>
        with your speeches.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.6><b>APLOMBOV.</b> I'm not a Spinosa or anybody of that sort, to go making<br>
        figures-of-eight with my legs. I am a serious man, and I have a<br>
        character, and I see no amusement in empty pleasures. But it isn't just<br>
        a matter of dances. You must excuse me, maman, but there is a good deal<br>
        in your behaviour which I am unable to understand. For instance, in<br>
        addition to objects of domestic importance, you promised also to give<br>
        me, with your daughter, two lottery tickets. Where are they?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.7><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> My head's aching a little... I expect it's on<br>
        account of the weather.... If only it thawed!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.8><b>APLOMBOV.</b> You won't get out of it like that. I only found out to-day<br>
        that those tickets are in pawn. You must excuse me,maman, but<br>
        it's only swindlers who behave like that. I'm not doing this out of<br>
        egoisticism [Note: So in the original]&mdash;I don't want your tickets&mdash;but<br>
        on principle; and I don't allow myself to be done by anybody. I have<br>
        made your daughter happy, and if you don't give me the tickets to-day<br>
        I'll make short work of her. I'm an honourable man!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.9><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> [Looks round the table and counts up the covers]<br>
        One, two, three, four, five...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.10><b>A WAITER.</b> The cook asks if you would like the ices served with rum,<br>
        madeira, or by themselves?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.11><b>APLOMBOV.</b> With rum. And tell the manager that there's not enough wine.<br>
        Tell him to prepare some more Haut Sauterne. [To NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA]<br>
        You also promised and agreed that a general was to be here to supper.<br>
        And where is he?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.12><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> That isn't my fault, my dear.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.13><b>APLOMBOV.</b> Whose fault, then?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.14><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> It's Andrey Andreyevitch's fault.... Yesterday he<br>
        came to see us and promised to bring a perfectly real general. [Sighs] I<br>
        suppose he couldn't find one anywhere, or he'd have brought him.... You<br>
        think we don't mind? We'd begrudge our child nothing. A general, of<br>
        course...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.15><b>APLOMBOV.</b> But there's more.... Everybody, including yourself,maman,<br>
        is aware of the fact that Yats, that telegraphist, was after Dashenka<br>
        before I proposed to her. Why did you invite him? Surely you knew it<br>
        would be unpleasant for me?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.16><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> Oh, how can you? Epaminond Maximovitch was married<br>
        himself only the other day, and you've already tired me and Dashenka out<br>
        with your talk. What will you be like in a year's time? You are horrid,<br>
        really horrid.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.17><b>APLOMBOV.</b> Then you don't like to hear the truth? Aha! Oh, oh! Then<br>
        behave honourably. I only want you to do one thing, be honourable!</a><br>
<p>[Couples dancing thegrand rondecome in at one door and out at<br>
        the other end. The first couple are DASHENKA with one of the GROOMSMEN.<br>
        The last are YATS and ZMEYUKINA. These two remain behind. ZHIGALOV and<br>
        DIMBA enter and go up to the table.]</p>
<a name=1.1.18><b>GROOMSMAN.</b> [Shouting] Promenade! Messieurs, promenade! [Behind]<br>
        Promenade!</a><br>
<p>[The dancers have all left the scene.]</p>
<a name=1.1.19><b>YATS.</b> [To ZMEYUKINA] Have pity! Have pity, adorable Anna Martinovna.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.20><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> Oh, what a man!... I've already told you that I've no voice<br>
        to-day.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.21><b>YATS.</b> I implore you to sing! Just one note! Have pity! Just one note!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.22><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> I'm tired of you.... [Sits and fans herself.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.23><b>YATS.</b> No, you're simply heartless! To be so cruel&mdash;if I may express<br>
        myself&mdash;and to have such a beautiful, beautiful voice! With such a<br>
        voice, if you will forgive my using the word, you shouldn't be a<br>
        midwife, but sing at concerts, at public gatherings! For example, how<br>
        divinely you do thatfioritura... that... [Sings] "I loved you;<br>
        love was vain then...." Exquisite!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.24><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> [Sings] "I loved you, and may love again." Is that it?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.25><b>YATS.</b> That's it! Beautiful!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.26><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> No, I've no voice to-day.... There, wave this fan for me...<br>
        it's hot! [To APLOMBOV] Epaminond Maximovitch, why are you so<br>
        melancholy? A bridegroom shouldn't be! Aren't you ashamed of yourself,<br>
        you wretch? Well, what are you so thoughtful about?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.27><b>APLOMBOV.</b> Marriage is a serious step! Everything must be considered from<br>
        all sides, thoroughly.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.28><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> What beastly sceptics you all are! I feel quite suffocated<br>
        with you all around.... Give me atmosphere! Do you hear? Give me<br>
        atmosphere! [Sings a few notes.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.29><b>YATS.</b> Beautiful! Beautiful!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.30><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> Fan me, fan me, or I feel I shall have a heart attack in a<br>
        minute. Tell me, please, why do I feel so suffocated?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.31><b>YATS.</b> It's because you're sweating....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.32><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> Foo, how vulgar you are! Don't dare to use such words!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.33><b>YATS.</b> Beg pardon! Of course, you're used, if I may say so, to<br>
        aristocratic society and....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.34><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> Oh, leave me alone! Give me poetry, delight! Fan me, fan me!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.35><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> [To DIMBA] Let's have another, what? [Pours out] One can<br>
        always drink. So long only, Harlampi Spiridonovitch, as one doesn't<br>
        forget one's business. Drink and be merry.... And if you can drink at<br>
        somebody else's expense, then why not drink? You can drink.... Your<br>
        health! [They drink] And do you have tigers in Greece?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.36><b>DIMBA.</b> Yes.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.37><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> And lions?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.38><b>DIMBA.</b> And lions too. In Russia zere's nussing, and in Greece zere's<br>
        everysing&mdash;my fazer and uncle and brozeres&mdash;and here zere's<br>
        nussing.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.39><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> H'm.... And are there whales in Greece?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.40><b>DIMBA.</b> Yes, everysing.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.41><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> [To her husband] What are they all eating and<br>
        drinking like that for? It's time for everybody to sit down to supper.<br>
        Don't keep on shoving your fork into the lobsters.... They're for the<br>
        general. He may come yet....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.42><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> And are there lobsters in Greece?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.43><b>DIMBA.</b> Yes... zere is everysing.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.44><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> Hm.... And Civil Servants.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.45><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> I can imagine what the atmosphere is like in Greece!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.46><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> There must be a lot of swindling. The Greeks are just like the<br>
        Armenians or gipsies. They sell you a sponge or a goldfish and all the<br>
        time they are looking out for a chance of getting something extra out of<br>
        you. Let's have another, what?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.47><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> What do you want to go on having another for? It's<br>
        time everybody sat down to supper. It's past eleven.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.48><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> If it's time, then it's time. Ladies and gentlemen, please!<br>
        [Shouts] Supper! Young people!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.49><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> Dear visitors, please be seated!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.50><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> [Sitting down at the table] Give me poetry.</a><br>
<p>Give me the storm!</p>
<a name=1.1.51><b>YATS.</b> [Aside] Wonderful woman! I'm in love! Up to my ears!</a><br>
<p>[Enter DASHENKA, MOZGOVOY, GROOMSMEN, various ladies and gentlemen, etc.<br>
        They all noisily seat themselves at the table. There is a minute's<br>
        pause, while the band plays a march.]</p>
<a name=1.1.52><b>MOZGOVOY.</b> [Rising] Ladies and gentlemen! I must tell you this.... We are<br>
        going to have a great many toasts and speeches. Don't let's wait, but<br>
        begin at once. Ladies and gentlemen, the newly married!</a><br>
<p>[The band plays a flourish. Cheers. Glasses are touched. APLOMBOV and<br>
        DASHENKA kiss each other.]</p>
<a name=1.1.53><b>YATS.</b> Beautiful! Beautiful! I must say, ladies and gentlemen, giving<br>
        honour where it is due, that this room and the accommodation generally<br>
        are splendid! Excellent, wonderful! Only you know, there's one thing we<br>
        haven't got&mdash;electric light, if I may say so! Into every country<br>
        electric light has already been introduced, only Russia lags behind.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.54><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> [Meditatively] Electricity... h'm.... In my opinion electric<br>
        lighting is just a swindle.... They put a live coal in and think you<br>
        don't see them! No, if you want a light, then you don't take a coal, but<br>
        something real, something special, that you can get hold of! You must<br>
        have a fire, you understand, which is natural, not just an invention!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.55><b>YATS.</b> If you'd ever seen an electric battery, and how it's made up,<br>
        you'd think differently.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.56><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> Don't want to see one. It's a swindle, a fraud on the<br>
        public.... They want to squeeze our last breath out of us.... We know<br>
        then, these... And, young man, instead of defending a swindle, you would<br>
        be much better occupied if you had another yourself and poured out some<br>
        for other people&mdash;yes!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.57><b>APLOMBOV.</b> I entirely agree with you, papa. Why start a learned<br>
        discussion? I myself have no objection to talking about every possible<br>
        scientific discovery, but this isn't the time for all that! [To<br>
        DASHENKA] What do you think,ma chËre?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.58><b>DASHENKA.</b> They want to show how educated they are, and so they always<br>
        talk about things we can't understand.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.59><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> Thank God, we've lived our time without being<br>
        educated, and here we are marrying off our third daughter to an honest<br>
        man. And if you think we're uneducated, then what do you want to come<br>
        here for? Go to your educated friends!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.60><b>YATS.</b> I, Nastasya Timofeyevna, have always held your family in respect,<br>
        and if I did start talking about electric lighting it doesn't mean that<br>
        I'm proud. I'll drink, to show you. I have always sincerely wished Daria<br>
        Evdokimovna a good husband. In these days, Nastasya Timofeyevna, it is<br>
        difficult to find a good husband. Nowadays everybody is on the look-out<br>
        for a marriage where there is profit, money....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.61><b>APLOMBOV.</b> That's a hint!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.62><b>YATS.</b> [His courage failing] I wasn't hinting at anything.... Present<br>
        company is always excepted.... I was only in general.... Please!<br>
        Everybody knows that you're marrying for love... the dowry is quite<br>
        trifling.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.63><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> No, it isn't trifling! You be careful what you<br>
        say. Besides a thousand roubles of good money, we're giving three<br>
        dresses, the bed, and all the furniture. You won't find another dowry<br>
        like that in a hurry!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.64><b>YATS.</b> I didn't mean... The furniture's splendid, of course, and... and<br>
        the dresses, but I never hinted at what they are getting offended at.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.65><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> Don't you go making hints. We respect you on<br>
        account of your parents, and we've invited you to the wedding, and here<br>
        you go talking. If you knew that Epaminond Maximovitch was marrying for<br>
        profit, why didn't you say so before? [Tearfully] I brought her up, I<br>
        fed her, I nursed her.... I cared for her more than if she was an<br>
        emerald jewel, my little girl....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.66><b>APLOMBOV.</b> And you go and believe him? Thank you so much! I'm very<br>
        grateful to you! [To YATS] And as for you, Mr. Yats, although you are<br>
        acquainted with me, I shan't allow you to behave like this in another's<br>
        house. Please get out of this!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.67><b>YATS.</b> What do you mean?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.68><b>APLOMBOV.</b> I want you to be as straightforward as I am! In short, please<br>
        get out! [Band plays a flourish]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.69><b>THE GENTLEMEN.</b> Leave him alone! Sit down! Is it worth it! Let him be!<br>
        Stop it now!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.70><b>YATS.</b> I never... I... I don't understand.... Please, I'll go.... Only<br>
        you first give me the five roubles which you borrowed from me last year<br>
        on the strength of apiquÈwaistcoat, if I may say so. Then I'll<br>
        just have another drink and... go, only give me the money first.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.71><b>VARIOUS GENTLEMEN.</b> Sit down! That's enough! Is it worth it, just for<br>
        such trifles?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.72><b>A GROOMSMAN.</b> [Shouts] The health of the bride's parents, Evdokim<br>
        Zaharitch and Nastasya Timofeyevna! [Band plays a flourish. Cheers.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.73><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> [Bows in all directions, in great emotion] I thank you! Dear<br>
        guests! I am very grateful to you for not having forgotten and for<br>
        having conferred this honour upon us without being standoffish And you<br>
        must not think that I'm a rascal, or that I'm trying to swindle anybody.<br>
        I'm speaking from my heart&mdash;from the purity of my soul! I wouldn't<br>
        deny anything to good people! We thank you very humbly! [Kisses.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.74><b>DASHENKA.</b> [To her mother] Mama, why are you crying? I'm so happy!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.75><b>APLOMBOV.</b>Mamanis disturbed at your coming separation. But I<br>
        should advise her rather to remember the last talk we had.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.76><b>YATS.</b> Don't cry, Nastasya Timofeyevna! Just think what are human tears,<br>
        anyway? Just petty psychiatry, and nothing more!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.77><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> And are there any red-haired men in Greece?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.78><b>DIMBA.</b> Yes, everysing is zere.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.79><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> But you don't have our kinds of mushroom.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.80><b>DIMBA.</b> Yes, we've got zem and everysing.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.81><b>MOZGOVOY.</b> Harlampi Spiridonovitch, it's your turn to speak! Ladies and<br>
        gentlemen, a speech!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.82><b>ALL.</b> [To DIMBA] Speech! speech! Your turn!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.83><b>DIMBA.</b> Why? I don't understand.... What is it!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.84><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> No, no! You can't refuse! It's you turn! Get up!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.85><b>DIMBA.</b> [Gets up, confused] I can't say what... Zere's Russia and zere's<br>
        Greece. Zere's people in Russia and people in Greece.... And zere's<br>
        people swimming the sea in karavs, which mean sips, and people on the<br>
        land in railway trains. I understand. We are Greeks and you are<br>
        Russians, and I want nussing.... I can tell you... zere's Russia and<br>
        zere's Greece...</a><br>
<p>[Enter NUNIN.]</p>
<a name=1.1.86><b>NUNIN.</b> Wait, ladies and gentlemen, don't eat now! Wait! Just one minute,<br>
        Nastasya Timofeyevna! Just come here, if you don't mind! [Takes NASTASYA<br>
        TIMOFEYEVNA aside, puffing] Listen... The General's coming... I found<br>
        one at last.... I'm simply worn out.... A real General, a solid one&mdash;old,<br>
        you know, aged perhaps eighty, or even ninety.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.87><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> When is he coming?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.88><b>NUNIN.</b> This minute. You'll be grateful to me all your life. [Note: A few<br>
        lines have been omitted: they refer to the "General's" rank and its<br>
        civil equivalent in words for which the English language has no<br>
        corresponding terms. The "General" is an ex-naval officer, a<br>
        second-class captain.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.89><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> You're not deceiving me, Andrey darling?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.90><b>NUNIN.</b> Well, now, am I a swindler? You needn't worry!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.91><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> [Sighs] One doesn't like to spend money for<br>
        nothing, Andrey darling!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.92><b>NUNIN.</b> Don't you worry! He's not a general, he's a dream! [Raises his<br>
        voice] I said to him: "You've quite forgotten us, your Excellency! It<br>
        isn't kind of your Excellency to forget your old friends! Nastasya<br>
        Timofeyevna," I said to him, "she's very annoyed with you about it!"<br>
        [Goes and sits at the table] And he says to me: "But, my friend, how can<br>
        I go when I don't know the bridegroom?" "Oh, nonsense, your excellency,<br>
        why stand on ceremony? The bridegroom," I said to him, "he's a fine<br>
        fellow, very free and easy. He's a valuer," I said, "at the Law courts,<br>
        and don't you think, your excellency, that he's some rascal, some knave<br>
        of hearts. Nowadays," I said to him, "even decent women are employed at<br>
        the Law courts." He slapped me on the shoulder, we smoked a Havana cigar<br>
        each, and now he's coming.... Wait a little, ladies and gentlemen, don't<br>
        eat....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.93><b>APLOMBOV.</b> When's he coming?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.94><b>NUNIN.</b> This minute. When I left him he was already putting on his<br>
        goloshes. Wait a little, ladies and gentlemen, don't eat yet.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.95><b>APLOMBOV.</b> The band should be told to play a march.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.96><b>NUNIN.</b> [Shouts] Musicians! A march! [The band plays a march for a<br>
        minute.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.97><b>A WAITER.</b> Mr. Revunov-Karaulov!</a><br>
<p>[ZHIGALOV, NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA, and NUNIN run to meet him. Enter<br>
        REVUNOV-KARAULOV.]</p>
<a name=1.1.98><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> [Bowing] Please come in, your excellency! So glad<br>
        you've come!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.99><b>REVUNOV.</b> Awfully!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.100><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> We, your excellency, aren't celebrities, we aren't important,<br>
        but quite ordinary, but don't think on that account that there's any<br>
        fraud. We put good people into the best place, we begrudge nothing.<br>
        Please!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.101><b>REVUNOV.</b> Awfully glad!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.102><b>NUNIN.</b> Let me introduce to you, your excellency, the bridegroom,<br>
        Epaminond Maximovitch Aplombov, with his newly born... I mean his newly<br>
        married wife! Ivan Mihailovitch Yats, employed on the telegraph! A<br>
        foreigner of Greek nationality, a confectioner by trade, Harlampi<br>
        Spiridonovitch Dimba! Osip Lukitch Babelmandebsky! And so on, and so<br>
        on.... The rest are just trash. Sit down, your excellency!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.103><b>REVUNOV.</b> Awfully! Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to say<br>
        two words to Andrey. [Takes NUNIN aside] I say, old man, I'm a little<br>
        put out.... Why do you call me your excellency? I'm not a general! I<br>
        don't rank as the equivalent of a colonel, even.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.104><b>NUNIN.</b> [Whispers] I know, only, Fyodor Yakovlevitch, be a good man and<br>
        let us call you your excellency! The family here, you see, is<br>
        patriarchal; it respects the aged, it likes rank.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.105><b>REVUNOV.</b> Oh, if it's like that, very well.... [Goes to the table]<br>
        Awfully!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.106><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> Sit down, your excellency! Be so good as to have<br>
        some of this, your excellency! Only forgive us for not being used to<br>
        etiquette; we're plain people!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.107><b>REVUNOV.</b> [Not hearing] What? Hm... yes. [Pause] Yes.... In the old days<br>
        everybody used to live simply and was happy. In spite of my rank, I am a<br>
        man who lives plainly. To-day Andrey comes to me and asks me to come<br>
        here to the wedding. "How shall I go," I said, "when I don't know them?<br>
        It's not good manners!" But he says: "They are good, simple, patriarchal<br>
        people, glad to see anybody." Well, if that's the case... why not? Very<br>
        glad to come. It's very dull for me at home by myself, and if my<br>
        presence at a wedding can make anybody happy, then I'm delighted to be<br>
        here....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.108><b>ZHIGALOV.</b> Then that's sincere, is it, your excellency? I respect that!<br>
        I'm a plain man myself, without any deception, and I respect others who<br>
        are like that. Eat, your excellency!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.109><b>APLOMBOV.</b> Is it long since you retired, your excellency?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.110><b>REVUNOV.</b> Eh? Yes, yes.... Quite true.... Yes. But, excuse me, what is<br>
        this? The fish is sour... and the bread is sour. I can't eat this!<br>
        [APLOMBOV and DASHENKA kiss each other] He, he, he... Your health!<br>
        [Pause] Yes.... In the old days everything was simple and everybody was<br>
        glad.... I love simplicity.... I'm an old man. I retired in 1865. I'm<br>
        72. Yes, of course, in my younger days it was different, but&mdash;[Sees<br>
        MOZGOVOY] You there... a sailor, are you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.111><b>MOZGOVOY.</b> Yes, just so.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.112><b>REVUNOV.</b> Aha, so... yes. The navy means hard work. There's a lot to<br>
        think about and get a headache over. Every insignificant word has, so to<br>
        speak, its special meaning! For instance, "Hoist her top-sheets and<br>
        mainsail!" What's it mean? A sailor can tell! He, he!&mdash;With almost<br>
        mathematical precision!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.113><b>NUNIN.</b> The health of his excellency Fyodor Yakovlevitch<br>
        Revunov-Karaulov! [Band plays a flourish. Cheers.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.114><b>YATS.</b> You, your excellency, have just expressed yourself on the subject<br>
        of the hard work involved in a naval career. But is telegraphy any<br>
        easier? Nowadays, your excellency, nobody is appointed to the telegraphs<br>
        if he cannot read and write French and German. But the transmission of<br>
        telegrams is the most difficult thing of all. Awfully difficult! Just<br>
        listen.</a><br>
<p>[Taps with his fork on the table, like a telegraphic transmitter.]</p>
<a name=1.1.115><b>REVUNOV.</b> What does that mean?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.116><b>YATS.</b> It means, "I honour you, your excellency, for your virtues." You<br>
        think it's easy? Listen now. [Taps.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.117><b>REVUNOV.</b> Louder; I can't hear....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.118><b>YATS.</b> That means, "Madam, how happy I am to hold you in my embraces!"</a><br>
<a name=1.1.119><b>REVUNOV.</b> What madam are you talking about? Yes.... [To MOZGOVOY] Yes, if<br>
        there's a head-wind you must... let's see... you must hoist your foretop<br>
        halyards and topsail halyards! The order is: "On the cross-trees to the<br>
        foretop halyards and topsail halyards" and at the same time, as the<br>
        sails get loose, you take hold underneath of the foresail and<br>
        fore-topsail halyards, stays and braces.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.120><b>A GROOMSMAN.</b> [Rising] Ladies and gentlemen...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.121><b>REVUNOV.</b> [Cutting him short] Yes... there are a great many orders to<br>
        give. "Furl the fore-topsail and the foretop-gallant sail!!" Well, what<br>
        does that mean? It's very simple! It means that if the top and<br>
        top-gallant sails are lifting the halyards, they must level the foretop<br>
        and foretop-gallant halyards on the hoist and at the same time the<br>
        top-gallants braces, as needed, are loosened according to the direction<br>
        of the wind...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.122><b>NUNIN.</b> [To REVUNOV] Fyodor Yakovlevitch, Mme. Zhigalov asks you to talk<br>
        about something else. It's very dull for the guests, who can't<br>
        understand....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.123><b>REVUNOV.</b> What? Who's dull? [To MOZGOVOY] Young man! Now suppose the ship<br>
        is lying by the wind, on the starboard tack, under full sail, and you've<br>
        got to bring her before the wind. What's the order? Well, first you<br>
        whistle up above! He, he!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.124><b>NUNIN.</b> Fyodor Yakovlevitch, that's enough. Eat something.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.125><b>REVUNOV.</b> As soon as the men are on deck you give the order, "To your<br>
        places!" What a life! You give orders, and at the same time you've got<br>
        to keep your eyes on the sailors, who run about like flashes of<br>
        lightning and get the sails and braces right. And at last you can't<br>
        restrain yourself, and you shout, "Good children!" [He chokes and<br>
        coughs.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.126><b>A GROOMSMAN.</b> [Making haste to use the ensuing pause to advantage] On<br>
        this occasion, so to speak, on the day on which we have met together to<br>
        honour our dear...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.127><b>REVUNOV.</b> [Interrupting] Yes, you've got to remember all that! For<br>
        instance, "Hoist the topsail halyards. Lower the topsail gallants!"</a><br>
<a name=1.1.128><b>THE GROOMSMAN.</b> [Annoyed] Why does he keep on interrupting? We shan't get<br>
        through a single speech like that!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.129><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> We are dull people, your excellency, and don't<br>
        understand a word of all that, but if you were to tell us something<br>
        appropriate...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.130><b>REVUNOV.</b> [Not hearing] I've already had supper, thank you. Did you say<br>
        there was goose? Thanks... yes. I've remembered the old days.... It's<br>
        pleasant, young man! You sail on the sea, you have no worries, and [In<br>
        an excited tone of voice] do you remember the joy of tacking? Is there a<br>
        sailor who doesn't glow at the memory of that manoeuvre? As soon as the<br>
        word is given and the whistle blown and the crew begins to go up&mdash;it's<br>
        as if an electric spark has run through them all. From the captain to<br>
        the cabin-boy, everybody's excited.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.131><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> How dull! How dull! [General murmur.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.132><b>REVUNOV.</b> [Who has not heard it properly] Thank you, I've had supper.<br>
        [With enthusiasm] Everybody's ready, and looks to the senior officer. He<br>
        gives the command: "Stand by, gallants and topsail braces on the<br>
        starboard side, main and counter-braces to port!" Everything's done in a<br>
        twinkling. Top-sheets and jib-sheets are pulled... taken to starboard.<br>
        [Stands up] The ship takes the wind and at last the sails fill out. The<br>
        senior officer orders, "To the braces," and himself keeps his eye on the<br>
        mainsail, and when at last this sail is filling out and the ship begins<br>
        to turn, he yells at the top of his voice, "Let go the braces! Loose the<br>
        main halyards!" Everything flies about, there's a general confusion for<br>
        a moment&mdash;and everything is done without an error. The ship has<br>
        been tacked!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.133><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> [Exploding] General, your manners.... You ought to<br>
        be ashamed of yourself, at your age!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.134><b>REVUNOV.</b> Did you say sausage? No, I haven't had any... thank you.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.135><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> [Loudly] I say you ought to be ashamed of yourself<br>
        at your age! General, your manners are awful!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.136><b>NUNIN.</b> [Confused] Ladies and gentlemen, is it worth it? Really...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.137><b>REVUNOV.</b> In the first place, I'm not a general, but a second-class naval<br>
        captain, which, according to the table of precedence, corresponds to a<br>
        lieutenant-colonel.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.138><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> If you're not a general, then what did you go and<br>
        take our money for? We never paid you money to behave like that!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.139><b>REVUNOV.</b> [Upset] What money?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.140><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> You know what money. You know that you got 25<br>
        roubles from Andrey Andreyevitch.... [To NUNIN] And you look out,<br>
        Andrey! I never asked you to hire a man like that!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.141><b>NUNIN.</b> There now... let it drop. Is it worth it?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.142><b>REVUNOV.</b> Paid... hired.... What is it?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.143><b>APLOMBOV.</b> Just let me ask you this. Did you receive 25 roubles from<br>
        Andrey Andreyevitch?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.144><b>REVUNOV.</b> What 25 roubles? [Suddenly realizing] That's what it is! Now I<br>
        understand it all.... How mean! How mean!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.145><b>APLOMBOV.</b> Did you take the money?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.146><b>REVUNOV.</b> I haven't taken any money! Get away from me! [Leaves the table]<br>
        How mean! How low! To insult an old man, a sailor, an officer who has<br>
        served long and faithfully! If you were decent people I could call<br>
        somebody out, but what can I do now? [Absently] Where's the door? Which<br>
        way do I go? Waiter, show me the way out! Waiter! [Going] How mean! How<br>
        low! [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.147><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> Andrey, where are those 25 roubles?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.148><b>NUNIN.</b> Is it worth while bothering about such trifles? What does it<br>
        matter! Everybody's happy here, and here you go.... [Shouts] The health<br>
        of the bride and bridegroom! A march! A march! [The band plays a march]<br>
        The health of the bride and bridegroom!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.149><b>ZMEYUKINA.</b> I'm suffocating! Give me atmosphere! I'm suffocating with you<br>
        all round me!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.150><b>YATS.</b> [In a transport of delight] My beauty! My beauty! [Uproar.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.151><b>A GROOMSMAN.</b> [Trying to shout everybody else down] Ladies and gentlemen!<br>
        On this occasion, if I may say so...</a><br>
