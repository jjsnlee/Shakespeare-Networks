<h2>A TRAGEDIAN IN SPITE OF HIMSELF</h2>
<a name=1.1.1><b>The scene is laid in St.</b> Petersburg, in MURASHKIN'S flat</a><br>
<p>[MURASHKIN'S study. Comfortable furniture. MURASHKIN is seated at his<br>
        desk. Enter TOLKACHOV holding in his hands a glass globe for a lamp, a<br>
        toy bicycle, three hat-boxes, a large parcel containing a dress, a<br>
        bin-case of beer, and several little parcels. He looks round stupidly<br>
        and lets himself down on the sofa in exhaustion.]</p>
<a name=1.1.2><b>MURASHKIN.</b> How do you do, Ivan Ivanovitch? Delighted to see you! What<br>
        brings you here?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.3><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> [Breathing heavily] My dear good fellow... I want to ask you<br>
        something.... I implore you lend me a revolver till to-morrow. Be a<br>
        friend!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.4><b>MURASHKIN.</b> What do you want a revolver for?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.5><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> I must have it.... Oh, little fathers!... give me some<br>
        water... water quickly!... I must have it... I've got to go through a<br>
        dark wood to-night, so in case of accidents... do, please, lend it to<br>
        me.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.6><b>MURASHKIN.</b> Oh, you liar, Ivan Ivanovitch! What the devil have you got to<br>
        do in a dark wood? I expect you are up to something. I can see by your<br>
        face that you are up to something. What's the matter with you? Are you<br>
        ill?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.7><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> Wait a moment, let me breathe.... Oh little mothers! I am<br>
        dog-tired. I've got a feeling all over me, and in my head as well, as if<br>
        I've been roasted on a spit. I can't stand it any longer. Be a friend,<br>
        and don't ask me any questions or insist on details; just give me the<br>
        revolver! I beseech you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.8><b>MURASHKIN.</b> Well, really! Ivan Ivanovitch, what cowardice is this? The<br>
        father of a family and a Civil Servant holding a responsible post! For<br>
        shame!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.9><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> What sort of a father of a family am I! I am a martyr. I am a<br>
        beast of burden, a nigger, a slave, a rascal who keeps on waiting here<br>
        for something to happen instead of starting off for the next world. I am<br>
        a rag, a fool, an idiot. Why am I alive? What's the use? [Jumps up] Well<br>
        now, tell me why am I alive? What's the purpose of this uninterrupted<br>
        series of mental and physical sufferings? I understand being a martyr to<br>
        an idea, yes! But to be a martyr to the devil knows what, skirts and<br>
        lamp-globes, no! I humbly decline! No, no, no! I've had enough! Enough!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.10><b>MURASHKIN.</b> Don't shout, the neighbours will hear you!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.11><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> Let your neighbours hear; it's all the same to me! If you<br>
        don't give me a revolver somebody else will, and there will be an end of<br>
        me anyway! I've made up my mind!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.12><b>MURASHKIN.</b> Hold on, you've pulled off a button. Speak calmly. I still<br>
        don't understand what's wrong with your life.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.13><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> What's wrong? You ask me what's wrong? Very well, I'll tell<br>
        you! Very well! I'll tell you everything, and then perhaps my soul will<br>
        be lighter. Let's sit down. Now listen... Oh, little mothers, I am out<br>
        of breath!... Just let's take to-day as an instance. Let's take to-day.<br>
        As you know, I've got to work at the Treasury from ten to four. It's<br>
        hot, it's stuffy, there are flies, and, my dear fellow, the very dickens<br>
        of a chaos. The Secretary is on leave, Khrapov has gone to get married,<br>
        and the smaller fry is mostly in the country, making love or occupied<br>
        with amateur theatricals. Everybody is so sleepy, tired, and done up<br>
        that you can't get any sense out of them. The Secretary's duties are in<br>
        the hands of an individual who is deaf in the left ear and in love; the<br>
        public has lost its memory; everybody is running about angry and raging,<br>
        and there is such a hullabaloo that you can't hear yourself speak.<br>
        Confusion and smoke everywhere. And my work is deathly: always the same,<br>
        always the same&mdash;first a correction, then a reference back, another<br>
        correction, another reference back; it's all as monotonous as the waves<br>
        of the sea. One's eyes, you understand, simply crawl out of one's head.<br>
        Give me some water.... You come out a broken, exhausted man. You would<br>
        like to dine and fall asleep, but you don't!&mdash;You remember that you<br>
        live in the country&mdash;that is, you are a slave, a rag, a bit of<br>
        string, a bit of limp flesh, and you've got to run round and do errands.<br>
        Where we live a pleasant custom has grown up: when a man goes to town<br>
        every wretched female inhabitant, not to mention one's own wife, has the<br>
        power and the right to give him a crowd of commissions. The wife orders<br>
        you to run into the modiste's and curse her for making a bodice too wide<br>
        across the chest and too narrow across the shoulders; little Sonya wants<br>
        a new pair of shoes; your sister-in-law wants some scarlet silk like the<br>
        pattern at twenty copecks and three arshins long.... Just wait; I'll<br>
        read you. [Takes a note out of his pocket and reads] A globe for the<br>
        lamp; one pound of pork sausages; five copecks' worth of cloves and<br>
        cinnamon; castor-oil for Misha; ten pounds of granulated sugar. To bring<br>
        with you from home: a copper jar for the sugar; carbolic acid; insect<br>
        powder, ten copecks' worth; twenty bottles of beer; vinegar; and corsets<br>
        for Mlle. Shanceau at No. 82.... Ouf! And to bring home Misha's winter<br>
        coat and goloshes. That is the order of my wife and family. Then there<br>
        are the commissions of our dear friends and neighbours&mdash;devil take<br>
        them! To-morrow is the name-day of Volodia Vlasin; I have to buy a<br>
        bicycle for him. The wife of Lieutenant-Colonel Virkhin is in an<br>
        interesting condition, and I am therefore bound to call in at the<br>
        midwife's every day and invite her to come. And so on, and so on. There<br>
        are five notes in my pocket and my handkerchief is all knots. And so, my<br>
        dear fellow, you spend the time between your office and your train,<br>
        running about the town like a dog with your tongue hanging out, running<br>
        and running and cursing life. From the clothier's to the chemist's, from<br>
        the chemist's to the modiste's, from the modiste's to the pork<br>
        butcher's, and then back again to the chemist's. In one place you<br>
        stumble, in a second you lose your money, in a third you forget to pay<br>
        and they raise a hue and cry after you, in a fourth you tread on the<br>
        train of a lady's dress.... Tfoo! You get so shaken up from all this<br>
        that your bones ache all night and you dream of crocodiles. Well, you've<br>
        made all your purchases, but how are you to pack all these things? For<br>
        instance, how are you to put a heavy copper jar together with the<br>
        lamp-globe or the carbolic acid with the tea? How are you to make a<br>
        combination of beer-bottles and this bicycle? It's the labours of<br>
        Hercules, a puzzle, a rebus! Whatever tricks you think of, in the long<br>
        run you're bound to smash or scatter something, and at the station and<br>
        in the train you have to stand with your arms apart, holding up some<br>
        parcel or other under your chin, with parcels, cardboard boxes, and<br>
        such-like rubbish all over you. The train starts, the passengers begin<br>
        to throw your luggage about on all sides: you've got your things on<br>
        somebody else's seat. They yell, they call for the conductor, they<br>
        threaten to have you put out, but what can I do? I just stand and blink<br>
        my eyes like a whacked donkey. Now listen to this. I get home. You think<br>
        I'd like to have a nice little drink after my righteous labours and a<br>
        good square meal&mdash;isn't that so?&mdash;but there is no chance of<br>
        that. My spouse has been on the look-out for me for some time. You've<br>
        hardly started on your soup when she has her claws into you, wretched<br>
        slave that you are&mdash;and wouldn't you like to go to some amateur<br>
        theatricals or to a dance? You can't protest. You are a husband, and the<br>
        word husband when translated into the language of summer residents in<br>
        the country means a dumb beast which you can load to any extent without<br>
        fear of the interference of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to<br>
        Animals. So you go and blink at "A Family Scandal" or something, you<br>
        applaud when your wife tells you to, and you feel worse and worse and<br>
        worse until you expect an apoplectic fit to happen any moment. If you go<br>
        to a dance you have to find partners for your wife, and if there is a<br>
        shortage of them then you dance the quadrilles yourself. You get back<br>
        from the theatre or the dance after midnight, when you are no longer a<br>
        man but a useless, limp rag. Well, at last you've got what you want; you<br>
        unrobe and get into bed. It's excellent&mdash;you can close your eyes<br>
        and sleep.... Everything is so nice, poetic, and warm, you understand;<br>
        there are no children squealing behind the wall, and you've got rid of<br>
        your wife, and your conscience is clear&mdash;what more can you want?<br>
        You fall asleep&mdash;and suddenly... you hear a buzz!... Gnats! [Jumps<br>
        up] Gnats! Be they triply accursed Gnats! [Shakes his fist] Gnats! It's<br>
        one of the plagues of Egypt, one of the tortures of the Inquisition!<br>
        Buzz! It sounds so pitiful, so pathetic, as if it's begging your pardon,<br>
        but the villain stings so that you have to scratch yourself for an hour<br>
        after. You smoke, and go for them, and cover yourself from head to foot,<br>
        but it is no good! At last you have to sacrifice yourself and let the<br>
        cursed things devour you. You've no sooner got used to the gnats when<br>
        another plague begins: downstairs your wife begins practising<br>
        sentimental songs with her two friends. They sleep by day and rehearse<br>
        for amateur concerts by night. Oh, my God! Those tenors are a torture<br>
        with which no gnats on earth can compare. [He sings] "Oh, tell me not my<br>
        youth has ruined you." "Before thee do I stand enchanted." Oh, the<br>
        beastly things! They've about killed me! So as to deafen myself a little<br>
        I do this: I drum on my ears. This goes on till four o'clock. Oh, give<br>
        me some more water, brother!... I can't... Well, not having slept, you<br>
        get up at six o'clock in the morning and off you go to the station. You<br>
        run so as not to be late, and it's muddy, foggy, cold&mdash;brr! Then<br>
        you get to town and start all over again. So there, brother. It's a<br>
        horrible life; I wouldn't wish one like it for my enemy. You understand&mdash;I'm<br>
        ill! Got asthma, heartburn&mdash;I'm always afraid of something. I've<br>
        got indigestion, everything is thick before me... I've become a regular<br>
        psychopath.... [Looking round] Only, between ourselves, I want to go<br>
        down to see Chechotte or Merzheyevsky. There's some devil in me,<br>
        brother. In moments of despair and suffering, when the gnats are<br>
        stinging or the tenors sing, everything suddenly grows dim; you jump up<br>
        and race round the whole house like a lunatic and shout, "I want blood!<br>
        Blood!" And really all the time you do want to let a knife into somebody<br>
        or hit him over the head with a chair. That's what life in a summer<br>
        villa leads to! And nobody has any sympathy for me, and everybody seems<br>
        to think it's all as it should be. People even laugh. But understand, I<br>
        am a living being and I want to live! This isn't farce, it's tragedy! I<br>
        say, if you don't give me your revolver, you might at any rate<br>
        sympathize.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.14><b>MURASHKIN.</b> I do sympathize.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.15><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> I see how much you sympathize.... Good-bye. I've got to buy<br>
        some anchovies and some sausage... and some tooth-powder, and then to<br>
        the station.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.16><b>MURASHKIN.</b> Where are you living?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.17><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> At Carrion River.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.18><b>MURASHKIN.</b> [Delighted] Really? Then you'll know Olga Pavlovna Finberg,<br>
        who lives there?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.19><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> I know her. We are even acquainted.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.20><b>MURASHKIN.</b> How perfectly splendid! That's so convenient, and it would be<br>
        so good of you...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.21><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> What's that?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.22><b>MURASHKIN.</b> My dear fellow, wouldn't you do one little thing for me? Be a<br>
        friend! Promise me now.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.23><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> What's that?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.24><b>MURASHKIN.</b> It would be such a friendly action! I implore you, my dear<br>
        man. In the first place, give Olga Pavlovna my very kind regards. In the<br>
        second place, there's a little thing I'd like you to take down to her.<br>
        She asked me to get a sewing-machine but I haven't anybody to send it<br>
        down to her by.... You take it, my dear! And you might at the same time<br>
        take down this canary in its cage... only be careful, or you'll break<br>
        the door.... What are you looking at me like that for?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.25><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> A sewing-machine... a canary in a cage... siskins,<br>
        chaffinches...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.26><b>MURASHKIN.</b> Ivan Ivanovitch, what's the matter with you? Why are you<br>
        turning purple?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.27><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> [Stamping] Give me the sewing-machine! Where's the bird-cage?<br>
        Now get on top yourself! Eat me! Tear me to pieces! Kill me! [Clenching<br>
        his fists] I want blood! Blood! Blood!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.28><b>MURASHKIN.</b> You've gone mad!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.29><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> [Treading on his feet] I want blood! Blood!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.30><b>MURASHKIN.</b> [In horror] He's gone mad! [Shouts] Peter! Maria! Where are<br>
        you? Help!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.31><b>TOLKACHOV.</b> [Chasing him round the room] I want blood! Blood!</a><br>
<p>Curtain.</p>
