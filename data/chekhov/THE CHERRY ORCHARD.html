<h2>THE CHERRY ORCHARD</h2>
<h3>ACT ONE</h3>
<p>[A room which is still called the nursery. One of the doors leads into<br>
        ANYA'S room. It is close on sunrise. It is May. The cherry-trees are in<br>
        flower but it is chilly in the garden. There is an early frost. The<br>
        windows of the room are shut. DUNYASHA comes in with a candle, and<br>
        LOPAKHIN with a book in his hand.]</p>
<a name=1.1.1><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> The train's arrived, thank God. What's the time?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.2><b>DUNYASHA.</b> It will soon be two. [Blows out candle] It is light already.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.3><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> How much was the train late? Two hours at least. [Yawns and<br>
        stretches himself] I have made a rotten mess of it! I came here on<br>
        purpose to meet them at the station, and then overslept myself... in my<br>
        chair. It's a pity. I wish you'd wakened me.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.4><b>DUNYASHA.</b> I thought you'd gone away. [Listening] I think I hear them<br>
        coming.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.5><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Listens] No.... They've got to collect their luggage and so<br>
        on.... [Pause] Lubov Andreyevna has been living abroad for five years; I<br>
        don't know what she'll be like now.... She's a good sort&mdash;an easy,<br>
        simple person. I remember when I was a boy of fifteen, my father, who is<br>
        dead&mdash;he used to keep a shop in the village here&mdash;hit me on<br>
        the face with his fist, and my nose bled.... We had gone into the yard<br>
        together for something or other, and he was a little drunk. Lubov<br>
        Andreyevna, as I remember her now, was still young, and very thin, and<br>
        she took me to the washstand here in this very room, the nursery. She<br>
        said, "Don't cry, little man, it'll be all right in time for your<br>
        wedding." [Pause] "Little man".... My father was a peasant, it's true,<br>
        but here I am in a white waistcoat and yellow shoes... a pearl out of an<br>
        oyster. I'm rich now, with lots of money, but just think about it and<br>
        examine me, and you'll find I'm still a peasant down to the marrow of my<br>
        bones. [Turns over the pages of his book] Here I've been reading this<br>
        book, but I understood nothing. I read and fell asleep. [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.6><b>DUNYASHA.</b> The dogs didn't sleep all night; they know that they're<br>
        coming.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.7><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> What's up with you, Dunyasha...?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.8><b>DUNYASHA.</b> My hands are shaking. I shall faint.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.9><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> You're too sensitive, Dunyasha. You dress just like a lady,<br>
        and you do your hair like one too. You oughtn't. You should know your<br>
        place.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.10><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> [Enters with a bouquet. He wears a short jacket and<br>
        brilliantly polished boots which squeak audibly. He drops the bouquet as<br>
        he enters, then picks it up] The gardener sent these; says they're to go<br>
        into the dining-room. [Gives the bouquet to DUNYASHA.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.11><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> And you'll bring me some kvass.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.12><b>DUNYASHA.</b> Very well. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.13><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> There's a frost this morning&mdash;three degrees, and the<br>
        cherry-trees are all in flower. I can't approve of our climate. [Sighs]<br>
        I can't. Our climate is indisposed to favour us even this once. And,<br>
        Ermolai Alexeyevitch, allow me to say to you, in addition, that I bought<br>
        myself some boots two days ago, and I beg to assure you that they squeak<br>
        in a perfectly unbearable manner. What shall I put on them?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.14><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Go away. You bore me.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.15><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> Some misfortune happens to me every day. But I don't<br>
        complain; I'm used to it, and I can smile. [DUNYASHA comes in and brings<br>
        LOPAKHIN some kvass] I shall go. [Knocks over a chair] There....<br>
        [Triumphantly] There, you see, if I may use the word, what circumstances<br>
        I am in, so to speak. It is even simply marvellous. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.16><b>DUNYASHA.</b> I may confess to you, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that Epikhodov has<br>
        proposed to me.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.17><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Ah!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.18><b>DUNYASHA.</b> I don't know what to do about it. He's a nice young man, but<br>
        every now and again, when he begins talking, you can't understand a word<br>
        he's saying. I think I like him. He's madly in love with me. He's an<br>
        unlucky man; every day something happens. We tease him about it. They<br>
        call him "Two-and-twenty troubles."</a><br>
<a name=1.1.19><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Listens] There they come, I think.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.20><b>DUNYASHA.</b> They're coming! What's the matter with me? I'm cold all over.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.21><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> There they are, right enough. Let's go and meet them. Will she<br>
        know me? We haven't seen each other for five years.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.22><b>DUNYASHA.</b> [Excited] I shall faint in a minute.... Oh, I'm fainting!</a><br>
<p>[Two carriages are heard driving up to the house. LOPAKHIN and DUNYASHA<br>
        quickly go out. The stage is empty. A noise begins in the next room.<br>
        FIERS, leaning on a stick, walks quickly across the stage; he has just<br>
        been to meet LUBOV ANDREYEVNA. He wears an old-fashioned livery and a<br>
        tall hat. He is saying something to himself, but not a word of it can be<br>
        made out. The noise behind the stage gets louder and louder. A voice is<br>
        heard: "Let's go in there." Enter LUBOV ANDREYEVNA, ANYA, and CHARLOTTA<br>
        IVANOVNA with a little dog on a chain, and all dressed in travelling<br>
        clothes, VARYA in a long coat and with a kerchief on her head. GAEV,<br>
        SIMEONOV-PISCHIN, LOPAKHIN, DUNYASHA with a parcel and an umbrella, and<br>
        a servant with luggage&mdash;all cross the room.]</p>
<a name=1.1.23><b>ANYA.</b> Let's come through here. Do you remember what this room is,<br>
        mother?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.24><b>LUBOV.</b> [Joyfully, through her tears] The nursery!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.25><b>VARYA.</b> How cold it is! My hands are quite numb. [To LUBOV ANDREYEVNA]<br>
        Your rooms, the white one and the violet one, are just as they used to<br>
        be, mother.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.26><b>LUBOV.</b> My dear nursery, oh, you beautiful room.... I used to sleep here<br>
        when I was a baby. [Weeps] And here I am like a little girl again.<br>
        [Kisses her brother, VARYA, then her brother again] And Varya is just as<br>
        she used to be, just like a nun. And I knew Dunyasha. [Kisses her.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.27><b>GAEV.</b> The train was two hours late. There now; how's that for<br>
        punctuality?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.28><b>CHARLOTTA.</b> [To PISCHIN] My dog eats nuts too.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.29><b>PISCHIN.</b> [Astonished] To think of that, now!</a><br>
<p>[All go out except ANYA and DUNYASHA.]</p>
<a name=1.1.30><b>DUNYASHA.</b> We did have to wait for you!</a><br>
<p>[Takes off ANYA'S cloak and hat.]</p>
<a name=1.1.31><b>ANYA.</b> I didn't get any sleep for four nights on the journey.... I'm<br>
        awfully cold.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.32><b>DUNYASHA.</b> You went away during Lent, when it was snowing and frosty, but<br>
        now? Darling! [Laughs and kisses her] We did have to wait for you, my<br>
        joy, my pet.... I must tell you at once, I can't bear to wait a minute.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.33><b>ANYA.</b> [Tired] Something else now...?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.34><b>DUNYASHA.</b> The clerk, Epikhodov, proposed to me after Easter.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.35><b>ANYA.</b> Always the same.... [Puts her hair straight] I've lost all my<br>
        hairpins.... [She is very tired, and even staggers as she walks.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.36><b>DUNYASHA.</b> I don't know what to think about it. He loves me, he loves me<br>
        so much!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.37><b>ANYA.</b> [Looks into her room; in a gentle voice] My room, my windows, as<br>
        if I'd never gone away. I'm at home! To-morrow morning I'll get up and<br>
        have a run in the garden....Oh, if I could only get to sleep! I didn't<br>
        sleep the whole journey, I was so bothered.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.38><b>DUNYASHA.</b> Peter Sergeyevitch came two days ago.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.39><b>ANYA.</b> [Joyfully] Peter!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.40><b>DUNYASHA.</b> He sleeps in the bath-house, he lives there. He said he was<br>
        afraid he'd be in the way. [Looks at her pocket-watch] I ought to wake<br>
        him, but Barbara Mihailovna told me not to. "Don't wake him," she said.</a><br>
<p>[Enter VARYA, a bunch of keys on her belt.]</p>
<a name=1.1.41><b>VARYA.</b> Dunyasha, some coffee, quick. Mother wants some.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.42><b>DUNYASHA.</b> This minute. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.43><b>VARYA.</b> Well, you've come, glory be to God. Home again. [Caressing her]<br>
        My darling is back again! My pretty one is back again!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.44><b>ANYA.</b> I did have an awful time, I tell you.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.45><b>VARYA.</b> I can just imagine it!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.46><b>ANYA.</b> I went away in Holy Week; it was very cold then. Charlotta talked<br>
        the whole way and would go on performing her tricks. Why did you tie<br>
        Charlotta on to me?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.47><b>VARYA.</b> You couldn't go alone, darling, at seventeen!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.48><b>ANYA.</b> We went to Paris; it's cold there and snowing. I talk French<br>
        perfectly horribly. My mother lives on the fifth floor. I go to her, and<br>
        find her there with various Frenchmen, women, an old abbÈ with a book,<br>
        and everything in tobacco smoke and with no comfort at all. I suddenly<br>
        became very sorry for mother&mdash;so sorry that I took her head in my<br>
        arms and hugged her and wouldn't let her go. Then mother started hugging<br>
        me and crying....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.49><b>VARYA.</b> [Weeping] Don't say any more, don't say any more....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.50><b>ANYA.</b> She's already sold her villa near Mentone; she's nothing left,<br>
        nothing. And I haven't a copeck left either; we only just managed to get<br>
        here. And mother won't understand! We had dinner at a station; she asked<br>
        for all the expensive things, and tipped the waiters one rouble each.<br>
        And Charlotta too. Yasha wants his share too&mdash;it's too bad.<br>
        Mother's got a footman now, Yasha; we've brought him here.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.51><b>VARYA.</b> I saw the wretch.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.52><b>ANYA.</b> How's business? Has the interest been paid?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.53><b>VARYA.</b> Not much chance of that.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.54><b>ANYA.</b> Oh God, oh God...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.55><b>VARYA.</b> The place will be sold in August.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.56><b>ANYA.</b> O God....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.57><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Looks in at the door and moos] Moo!... [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.58><b>VARYA.</b> [Through her tears] I'd like to.... [Shakes her fist.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.59><b>ANYA.</b> [Embraces VARYA, softly] Varya, has he proposed to you? [VARYA<br>
        shakes head] But he loves you.... Why don't you make up your minds? Why<br>
        do you keep on waiting?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.60><b>VARYA.</b> I think that it will all come to nothing. He's a busy man. I'm<br>
        not his affair... he pays no attention to me. Bless the man, I don't<br>
        want to see him.... But everybody talks about our marriage, everybody<br>
        congratulates me, and there's nothing in it at all, it's all like a<br>
        dream. [In another tone] You've got a brooch like a bee.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.61><b>ANYA.</b> [Sadly] Mother bought it. [Goes into her room, and talks lightly,<br>
        like a child] In Paris I went up in a balloon!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.62><b>VARYA.</b> My darling's come back, my pretty one's come back! [DUNYASHA has<br>
        already returned with the coffee-pot and is making the coffee, VARYA<br>
        stands near the door] I go about all day, looking after the house, and I<br>
        think all the time, if only you could marry a rich man, then I'd be<br>
        happy and would go away somewhere by myself, then to Kiev... to Moscow,<br>
        and so on, from one holy place to another. I'd tramp and tramp. That<br>
        would be splendid!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.63><b>ANYA.</b> The birds are singing in the garden. What time is it now?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.64><b>VARYA.</b> It must be getting on for three. Time you went to sleep, darling.<br>
        [Goes into ANYA'S room] Splendid!</a><br>
<p>[Enter YASHA with a plaid shawl and a travelling bag.]</p>
<a name=1.1.65><b>YASHA.</b> [Crossing the stage: Politely] May I go this way?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.66><b>DUNYASHA.</b> I hardly knew you, Yasha. You have changed abroad.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.67><b>YASHA.</b> Hm... and who are you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.68><b>DUNYASHA.</b> When you went away I was only so high. [Showing with her hand]<br>
        I'm Dunyasha, the daughter of Theodore Kozoyedov. You don't remember!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.69><b>YASHA.</b> Oh, you little cucumber!</a><br>
<p>[Looks round and embraces her. She screams and drops a saucer. YASHA<br>
        goes out quickly.]</p>
<a name=1.1.70><b>VARYA.</b> [In the doorway: In an angry voice] What's that?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.71><b>DUNYASHA.</b> [Through her tears] I've broken a saucer.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.72><b>VARYA.</b> It may bring luck.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.73><b>ANYA.</b> [Coming out of her room] We must tell mother that Peter's here.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.74><b>VARYA.</b> I told them not to wake him.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.75><b>ANYA.</b> [Thoughtfully] Father died six years ago, and a month later my<br>
        brother Grisha was drowned in the river&mdash;such a dear little boy of<br>
        seven! Mother couldn't bear it; she went away, away, without looking<br>
        round.... [Shudders] How I understand her; if only she knew! [Pause] And<br>
        Peter Trofimov was Grisha's tutor, he might tell her....</a><br>
<p>[Enter FIERS in a short jacket and white waistcoat.]</p>
<a name=1.1.76><b>FIERS.</b> [Goes to the coffee-pot, nervously] The mistress is going to have<br>
        some food here.... [Puts on white gloves] Is the coffee ready? [To<br>
        DUNYASHA, severely] You! Where's the cream?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.77><b>DUNYASHA.</b> Oh, dear me...! [Rapid exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.78><b>FIERS.</b> [Fussing round the coffee-pot] Oh, you bungler.... [Murmurs to<br>
        himself] Back from Paris... the master went to Paris once... in a<br>
        carriage.... [Laughs.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.79><b>VARYA.</b> What are you talking about, Fiers?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.80><b>FIERS.</b> I beg your pardon? [Joyfully] The mistress is home again. I've<br>
        lived to see her! Don't care if I die now.... [Weeps with joy.]</a><br>
<p>[Enter LUBOV ANDREYEVNA, GAEV, LOPAKHIN, and SIMEONOV-PISCHIN, the<br>
        latter in a long jacket of thin cloth and loose trousers. GAEV, coming<br>
        in, moves his arms and body about as if he is playing billiards.]</p>
<a name=1.1.81><b>LUBOV.</b> Let me remember now. Red into the corner! Twice into the centre!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.82><b>GAEV.</b> Right into the pocket! Once upon a time you and I used both to<br>
        sleep in this room, and now I'm fifty-one; it does seem strange.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.83><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Yes, time does go.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.84><b>GAEV.</b> Who does?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.85><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I said that time does go.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.86><b>GAEV.</b> It smells of patchouli here.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.87><b>ANYA.</b> I'm going to bed. Good-night, mother. [Kisses her.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.88><b>LUBOV.</b> My lovely little one. [Kisses her hand] Glad to be at home? I<br>
        can't get over it.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.89><b>ANYA.</b> Good-night, uncle.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.90><b>GAEV.</b> [Kisses her face and hands] God be with you. How you do resemble<br>
        your mother! [To his sister] You were just like her at her age, Luba.</a><br>
<p>[ANYA gives her hand to LOPAKHIN and PISCHIN and goes out, shutting the<br>
        door behind her.]</p>
<a name=1.1.91><b>LUBOV.</b> She's awfully tired.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.92><b>PISCHIN.</b> It's a very long journey.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.93><b>VARYA.</b> [To LOPAKHIN and PISCHIN] Well, sirs, it's getting on for three,<br>
        quite time you went.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.94><b>LUBOV.</b> [Laughs] You're just the same as ever, Varya. [Draws her close<br>
        and kisses her] I'll have some coffee now, then we'll all go. [FIERS<br>
        lays a cushion under her feet] Thank you, dear. I'm used to coffee. I<br>
        drink it day and night. Thank you, dear old man. [Kisses FIERS.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.95><b>VARYA.</b> I'll go and see if they've brought in all the luggage. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.96><b>LUBOV.</b> Is it really I who am sitting here? [Laughs] I want to jump about<br>
        and wave my arms. [Covers her face with her hands] But suppose I'm<br>
        dreaming! God knows I love my own country, I love it deeply; I couldn't<br>
        look out of the railway carriage, I cried so much. [Through her tears]<br>
        Still, I must have my coffee. Thank you, Fiers. Thank you, dear old man.<br>
        I'm so glad you're still with us.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.97><b>FIERS.</b> The day before yesterday.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.98><b>GAEV.</b> He doesn't hear well.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.99><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I've got to go off to Kharkov by the five o'clock train. I'm<br>
        awfully sorry! I should like to have a look at you, to gossip a little.<br>
        You're as fine-looking as ever.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.100><b>PISCHIN.</b> [Breathes heavily] Even finer-looking... dressed in Paris<br>
        fashions... confound it all.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.101><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Your brother, Leonid Andreyevitch, says I'm a snob, a usurer,<br>
        but that is absolutely nothing to me. Let him talk. Only I do wish you<br>
        would believe in me as you once did, that your wonderful, touching eyes<br>
        would look at me as they did before. Merciful God! My father was the<br>
        serf of your grandfather and your own father, but you&mdash;you more<br>
        than anybody else&mdash;did so much for me once upon a time that I've<br>
        forgotten everything and love you as if you belonged to my family... and<br>
        even more.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.102><b>LUBOV.</b> I can't sit still, I'm not in a state to do it. [Jumps up and<br>
        walks about in great excitement] I'll never survive this happiness....<br>
        You can laugh at me; I'm a silly woman.... My dear little cupboard.<br>
        [Kisses cupboard] My little table.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.103><b>GAEV.</b> Nurse has died in your absence.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.104><b>LUBOV.</b> [Sits and drinks coffee] Yes, bless her soul. I heard by letter.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.105><b>GAEV.</b> And Anastasius has died too. Peter Kosoy has left me and now lives<br>
        in town with the Commissioner of Police. [Takes a box of sugar-candy out<br>
        of his pocket and sucks a piece.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.106><b>PISCHIN.</b> My daughter, Dashenka, sends her love.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.107><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I want to say something very pleasant, very delightful, to<br>
        you. [Looks at his watch] I'm going away at once, I haven't much time...<br>
        but I'll tell you all about it in two or three words. As you already<br>
        know, your cherry orchard is to be sold to pay your debts, and the sale<br>
        is fixed for August 22; but you needn't be alarmed, dear madam, you may<br>
        sleep in peace; there's a way out. Here's my plan. Please attend<br>
        carefully! Your estate is only thirteen miles from the town, the railway<br>
        runs by, and if the cherry orchard and the land by the river are broken<br>
        up into building lots and are then leased off for villas you'll get at<br>
        least twenty-five thousand roubles a year profit out of it.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.108><b>GAEV.</b> How utterly absurd!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.109><b>LUBOV.</b> I don't understand you at all, Ermolai Alexeyevitch.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.110><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> You will get twenty-five roubles a year for each dessiatin<br>
        from the leaseholders at the very least, and if you advertise now I'm<br>
        willing to bet that you won't have a vacant plot left by the autumn;<br>
        they'll all go. In a word, you're saved. I congratulate you. Only, of<br>
        course, you'll have to put things straight, and clean up.... For<br>
        instance, you'll have to pull down all the old buildings, this house,<br>
        which isn't any use to anybody now, and cut down the old cherry<br>
        orchard....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.111><b>LUBOV.</b> Cut it down? My dear man, you must excuse me, but you don't<br>
        understand anything at all. If there's anything interesting or<br>
        remarkable in the whole province, it's this cherry orchard of ours.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.112><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> The only remarkable thing about the orchard is that it's very<br>
        large. It only bears fruit every other year, and even then you don't<br>
        know what to do with them; nobody buys any.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.113><b>GAEV.</b> This orchard is mentioned in the "Encyclopaedic Dictionary."</a><br>
<a name=1.1.114><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Looks at his watch] If we can't think of anything and don't<br>
        make up our minds to anything, then on August 22, both the cherry<br>
        orchard and the whole estate will be up for auction. Make up your mind!<br>
        I swear there's no other way out, I'll swear it again.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.115><b>FIERS.</b> In the old days, forty or fifty years back, they dried the<br>
        cherries, soaked them and pickled them, and made jam of them, and it<br>
        used to happen that...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.116><b>GAEV.</b> Be quiet, Fiers.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.117><b>FIERS.</b> And then we'd send the dried cherries off in carts to Moscow and<br>
        Kharkov. And money! And the dried cherries were soft, juicy, sweet, and<br>
        nicely scented.... They knew the way....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.118><b>LUBOV.</b> What was the way?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.119><b>FIERS.</b> They've forgotten. Nobody remembers.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.120><b>PISCHIN.</b> [To LUBOV ANDREYEVNA] What about Paris? Eh? Did you eat frogs?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.121><b>LUBOV.</b> I ate crocodiles.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.122><b>PISCHIN.</b> To think of that, now.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.123><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Up to now in the villages there were only the gentry and the<br>
        labourers, and now the people who live in villas have arrived. All towns<br>
        now, even small ones, are surrounded by villas. And it's safe to say<br>
        that in twenty years' time the villa resident will be all over the<br>
        place. At present he sits on his balcony and drinks tea, but it may well<br>
        come to pass that he'll begin to cultivate his patch of land, and then<br>
        your cherry orchard will be happy, rich, splendid....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.124><b>GAEV.</b> [Angry] What rot!</a><br>
<p>[Enter VARYA and YASHA.]</p>
<a name=1.1.125><b>VARYA.</b> There are two telegrams for you, little mother. [Picks out a key<br>
        and noisily unlocks an antique cupboard] Here they are.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.126><b>LUBOV.</b> They're from Paris.... [Tears them up without reading them] I've<br>
        done with Paris.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.127><b>GAEV.</b> And do you know, Luba, how old this case is? A week ago I took out<br>
        the bottom drawer; I looked and saw figures burnt out in it. That case<br>
        was made exactly a hundred years ago. What do you think of that? What?<br>
        We could celebrate its jubilee. It hasn't a soul of its own, but still,<br>
        say what you will, it's a fine bookcase.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.128><b>PISCHIN.</b> [Astonished] A hundred years.... Think of that!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.129><b>GAEV.</b> Yes... it's a real thing. [Handling it] My dear and honoured case!<br>
        I congratulate you on your existence, which has already for more than a<br>
        hundred years been directed towards the bright ideals of good and<br>
        justice; your silent call to productive labour has not grown less in the<br>
        hundred years [Weeping] during which you have upheld virtue and faith in<br>
        a better future to the generations of our race, educating us up to<br>
        ideals of goodness and to the knowledge of a common consciousness.<br>
        [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.130><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Yes....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.131><b>LUBOV.</b> You're just the same as ever, Leon.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.132><b>GAEV.</b> [A little confused] Off the white on the right, into the corner<br>
        pocket. Red ball goes into the middle pocket!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.133><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Looks at his watch] It's time I went.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.134><b>YASHA.</b> [Giving LUBOV ANDREYEVNA her medicine] Will you take your pills<br>
        now?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.135><b>PISCHIN.</b> You oughtn't to take medicines, dear madam; they do you neither<br>
        harm nor good.... Give them here, dear madam. [Takes the pills, turns<br>
        them out into the palm of his hand, blows on them, puts them into his<br>
        mouth, and drinks some kvass] There!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.136><b>LUBOV.</b> [Frightened] You're off your head!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.137><b>PISCHIN.</b> I've taken all the pills.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.138><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Gormandizer! [All laugh.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.139><b>FIERS.</b> They were here in Easter week and ate half a pailful of<br>
        cucumbers.... [Mumbles.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.140><b>LUBOV.</b> What's he driving at?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.141><b>VARYA.</b> He's been mumbling away for three years. We're used to that.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.142><b>YASHA.</b> Senile decay.</a><br>
<p>[CHARLOTTA IVANOVNA crosses the stage, dressed in white: she is very<br>
        thin and tightly laced; has a lorgnette at her waist.]</p>
<a name=1.1.143><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Excuse me, Charlotta Ivanovna, I haven't said "How do you do"<br>
        to you yet. [Tries to kiss her hand.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.144><b>CHARLOTTA.</b> [Takes her hand away] If you let people kiss your hand, then<br>
        they'll want your elbow, then your shoulder, and then...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.145><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> My luck's out to-day! [All laugh] Show us a trick, Charlotta<br>
        Ivanovna!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.146><b>LUBOV ANDREYEVNA.</b> Charlotta, do us a trick.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.147><b>CHARLOTTA.</b> It's not necessary. I want to go to bed. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.148><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> We shall see each other in three weeks. [Kisses LUBOV<br>
        ANDREYEVNA'S hand] Now, good-bye. It's time to go. [To GAEV] See you<br>
        again. [Kisses PISCHIN] Au revoir. [Gives his hand to VARYA, then to<br>
        FIERS and to YASHA] I don't want to go away. [To LUBOV ANDREYEVNA]. If<br>
        you think about the villas and make up your mind, then just let me know,<br>
        and I'll raise a loan of 50,000 roubles at once. Think about it<br>
        seriously.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.149><b>VARYA.</b> [Angrily] Do go, now!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.150><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I'm going, I'm going.... [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.151><b>GAEV.</b> Snob. Still, I beg pardon.... Varya's going to marry him, he's<br>
        Varya's young man.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.152><b>VARYA.</b> Don't talk too much, uncle.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.153><b>LUBOV.</b> Why not, Varya? I should be very glad. He's a good man.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.154><b>PISCHIN.</b> To speak the honest truth... he's a worthy man.... And my<br>
        Dashenka... also says that... she says lots of things. [Snores, but<br>
        wakes up again at once] But still, dear madam, if you could lend me...<br>
        240 roubles... to pay the interest on my mortgage to-morrow...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.155><b>VARYA.</b> [Frightened] We haven't got it, we haven't got it!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.156><b>LUBOV.</b> It's quite true. I've nothing at all.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.157><b>PISCHIN.</b> I'll find it all right [Laughs] I never lose hope. I used to<br>
        think, "Everything's lost now. I'm a dead man," when, lo and behold, a<br>
        railway was built over my land... and they paid me for it. And something<br>
        else will happen to-day or to-morrow. Dashenka may win 20,000 roubles...<br>
        she's got a lottery ticket.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.158><b>LUBOV.</b> The coffee's all gone, we can go to bed.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.159><b>FIERS.</b> [Brushing GAEV'S trousers; in an insistent tone] You've put on<br>
        the wrong trousers again. What am I to do with you?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.160><b>VARYA.</b> [Quietly] Anya's asleep. [Opens window quietly] The sun has risen<br>
        already; it isn't cold. Look, little mother: what lovely trees! And the<br>
        air! The starlings are singing!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.161><b>GAEV.</b> [Opens the other window] The whole garden's white. You haven't<br>
        forgotten, Luba? There's that long avenue going straight, straight, like<br>
        a stretched strap; it shines on moonlight nights. Do you remember? You<br>
        haven't forgotten?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.162><b>LUBOV.</b> [Looks out into the garden] Oh, my childhood, days of my<br>
        innocence! In this nursery I used to sleep; I used to look out from here<br>
        into the orchard. Happiness used to wake with me every morning, and then<br>
        it was just as it is now; nothing has changed. [Laughs from joy] It's<br>
        all, all white! Oh, my orchard! After the dark autumns and the cold<br>
        winters, you're young again, full of happiness, the angels of heaven<br>
        haven't left you.... If only I could take my heavy burden off my breast<br>
        and shoulders, if I could forget my past!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.163><b>GAEV.</b> Yes, and they'll sell this orchard to pay off debts. How strange<br>
        it seems!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.164><b>LUBOV.</b> Look, there's my dead mother going in the orchard... dressed in<br>
        white! [Laughs from joy] That's she.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.165><b>GAEV.</b> Where?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.166><b>VARYA.</b> God bless you, little mother.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.167><b>LUBOV.</b> There's nobody there; I thought I saw somebody. On the right, at<br>
        the turning by the summer-house, a white little tree bent down, looking<br>
        just like a woman. [Enter TROFIMOV in a worn student uniform and<br>
        spectacles] What a marvellous garden! White masses of flowers, the blue<br>
        sky....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.168><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Lubov Andreyevna! [She looks round at him] I only want to show<br>
        myself, and I'll go away. [Kisses her hand warmly] I was told to wait<br>
        till the morning, but I didn't have the patience.</a><br>
<p>[LUBOV ANDREYEVNA looks surprised.]</p>
<a name=1.1.169><b>VARYA.</b> [Crying] It's Peter Trofimov.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.170><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Peter Trofimov, once the tutor of your Grisha.... Have I<br>
        changed so much?</a><br>
<p>[LUBOV ANDREYEVNA embraces him and cries softly.]</p>
<a name=1.1.171><b>GAEV.</b> [Confused] That's enough, that's enough, Luba.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.172><b>VARYA.</b> [Weeps] But I told you, Peter, to wait till to-morrow.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.173><b>LUBOV.</b> My Grisha... my boy... Grisha... my son.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.174><b>VARYA.</b> What are we to do, little mother? It's the will of God.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.175><b>TROFIMOV.</b> [Softly, through his tears] It's all right, it's all right.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.176><b>LUBOV.</b> [Still weeping] My boy's dead; he was drowned. Why? Why, my<br>
        friend? [Softly] Anya's asleep in there. I am speaking so loudly, making<br>
        such a noise.... Well, Peter? What's made you look so bad? Why have you<br>
        grown so old?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.177><b>TROFIMOV.</b> In the train an old woman called me a decayed gentleman.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.178><b>LUBOV.</b> You were quite a boy then, a nice little student, and now your<br>
        hair is not at all thick and you wear spectacles. Are you really still a<br>
        student? [Goes to the door.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.179><b>TROFIMOV.</b> I suppose I shall always be a student.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.180><b>LUBOV.</b> [Kisses her brother, then VARYA] Well, let's go to bed.... And<br>
        you've grown older, Leonid.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.181><b>PISCHIN.</b> [Follows her] Yes, we've got to go to bed.... Oh, my gout! I'll<br>
        stay the night here. If only, Lubov Andreyevna, my dear, you could get<br>
        me 240 roubles to-morrow morning&mdash;</a><br>
<a name=1.1.182><b>GAEV.</b> Still the same story.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.183><b>PISCHIN.</b> Two hundred and forty roubles... to pay the interest on the<br>
        mortgage.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.184><b>LUBOV.</b> I haven't any money, dear man.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.185><b>PISCHIN.</b> I'll give it back... it's a small sum....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.186><b>LUBOV.</b> Well, then, Leonid will give it to you.... Let him have it,<br>
        Leonid.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.187><b>GAEV.</b> By all means; hold out your hand.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.188><b>LUBOV.</b> Why not? He wants it; he'll give it back.</a><br>
<p>[LUBOV ANDREYEVNA, TROFIMOV, PISCHIN, and FIERS go out. GAEV, VARYA, and<br>
        YASHA remain.]</p>
<a name=1.1.189><b>GAEV.</b> My sister hasn't lost the habit of throwing money about. [To<br>
        YASHA] Stand off, do; you smell of poultry.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.190><b>YASHA.</b> [Grins] You are just the same as ever, Leonid Andreyevitch.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.191><b>GAEV.</b> Really? [To VARYA] What's he saying?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.192><b>VARYA.</b> [To YASHA] Your mother's come from the village; she's been<br>
        sitting in the servants' room since yesterday, and wants to see you....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.193><b>YASHA.</b> Bless the woman!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.194><b>VARYA.</b> Shameless man.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.195><b>YASHA.</b> A lot of use there is in her coming. She might have come tomorrow<br>
        just as well. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.196><b>VARYA.</b> Mother hasn't altered a scrap, she's just as she always was.<br>
        She'd give away everything, if the idea only entered her head.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.197><b>GAEV.</b> Yes.... [Pause] If there's any illness for which people offer many<br>
        remedies, you may be sure that particular illness is incurable, I think.<br>
        I work my brains to their hardest. I've several remedies, very many, and<br>
        that really means I've none at all. It would be nice to inherit a<br>
        fortune from somebody, it would be nice to marry our Anya to a rich man,<br>
        it would be nice to go to Yaroslav and try my luck with my aunt the<br>
        Countess. My aunt is very, very rich.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.198><b>VARYA.</b> [Weeps] If only God helped us.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.199><b>GAEV.</b> Don't cry. My aunt's very rich, but she doesn't like us. My<br>
        sister, in the first place, married an advocate, not a noble.... [ANYA<br>
        appears in the doorway] She not only married a man who was not a noble,<br>
        but she behaved herself in a way which cannot be described as proper.<br>
        She's nice and kind and charming, and I'm very fond of her, but say what<br>
        you will in her favour and you still have to admit that she's wicked;<br>
        you can feel it in her slightest movements.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.200><b>VARYA.</b> [Whispers] Anya's in the doorway.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.201><b>GAEV.</b> Really? [Pause] It's curious, something's got into my right eye...<br>
        I can't see properly out of it. And on Thursday, when I was at the<br>
        District Court...</a><br>
<p>[Enter ANYA.]</p>
<a name=1.1.202><b>VARYA.</b> Why aren't you in bed, Anya?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.203><b>ANYA.</b> Can't sleep. It's no good.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.204><b>GAEV.</b> My darling! [Kisses ANYA'S face and hands] My child.... [Crying]<br>
        You're not my niece, you're my angel, you're my all.... Believe in me,<br>
        believe...</a><br>
<a name=1.1.205><b>ANYA.</b> I do believe in you, uncle. Everybody loves you and respects<br>
        you... but, uncle dear, you ought to say nothing, no more than that.<br>
        What were you saying just now about my mother, your own sister? Why did<br>
        you say those things?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.206><b>GAEV.</b> Yes, yes. [Covers his face with her hand] Yes, really, it was<br>
        awful. Save me, my God! And only just now I made a speech before a<br>
        bookcase... it's so silly! And only when I'd finished I knew how silly<br>
        it was.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.207><b>VARYA.</b> Yes, uncle dear, you really ought to say less. Keep quiet, that's<br>
        all.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.208><b>ANYA.</b> You'd be so much happier in yourself if you only kept quiet.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.209><b>GAEV.</b> All right, I'll be quiet. [Kisses their hands] I'll be quiet. But<br>
        let's talk business. On Thursday I was in the District Court, and a lot<br>
        of us met there together, and we began to talk of this, that, and the<br>
        other, and now I think I can arrange a loan to pay the interest into the<br>
        bank.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.210><b>VARYA.</b> If only God would help us!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.211><b>GAEV.</b> I'll go on Tuesday. I'll talk with them about it again. [To VARYA]<br>
        Don't howl. [To ANYA] Your mother will have a talk to Lopakhin; he, of<br>
        course, won't refuse... And when you've rested you'll go to Yaroslav to<br>
        the Countess, your grandmother. So you see, we'll have three irons in<br>
        the fire, and we'll be safe. We'll pay up the interest. I'm certain.<br>
        [Puts some sugar-candy into his mouth] I swear on my honour, on anything<br>
        you will, that the estate will not be sold! [Excitedly] I swear on my<br>
        happiness! Here's my hand. You may call me a dishonourable wretch if I<br>
        let it go to auction! I swear by all I am!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.212><b>ANYA.</b> [She is calm again and happy] How good and clever you are, uncle.<br>
        [Embraces him] I'm happy now! I'm happy! All's well!</a><br>
<p>[Enter FIERS.]</p>
<a name=1.1.213><b>FIERS.</b> [Reproachfully] Leonid Andreyevitch, don't you fear God? When are<br>
        you going to bed?</a><br>
<a name=1.1.214><b>GAEV.</b> Soon, soon. You go away, Fiers. I'll undress myself. Well,<br>
        children, bye-bye...! I'll give you the details to-morrow, but let's go<br>
        to bed now. [Kisses ANYA and VARYA] I'm a man of the eighties.... People<br>
        don't praise those years much, but I can still say that I've suffered<br>
        for my beliefs. The peasants don't love me for nothing, I assure you.<br>
        We've got to learn to know the peasants! We ought to learn how....</a><br>
<a name=1.1.215><b>ANYA.</b> You're doing it again, uncle!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.216><b>VARYA.</b> Be quiet, uncle!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.217><b>FIERS.</b> [Angrily] Leonid Andreyevitch!</a><br>
<a name=1.1.218><b>GAEV.</b> I'm coming, I'm coming.... Go to bed now. Off two cushions into<br>
        the middle! I turn over a new leaf.... [Exit. FIERS goes out after him.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.219><b>ANYA.</b> I'm quieter now. I don't want to go to Yaroslav, I don't like<br>
        grandmother; but I'm calm now; thanks to uncle. [Sits down.]</a><br>
<a name=1.1.220><b>VARYA.</b> It's time to go to sleep. I'll go. There's been an unpleasantness<br>
        here while you were away. In the old servants' part of the house, as you<br>
        know, only the old people live&mdash;little old Efim and Polya and<br>
        Evstigney, and Karp as well. They started letting some tramps or other<br>
        spend the night there&mdash;I said nothing. Then I heard that they were<br>
        saying that I had ordered them to be fed on peas and nothing else; from<br>
        meanness, you see.... And it was all Evstigney's doing.... Very well, I<br>
        thought, if that's what the matter is, just you wait. So I call<br>
        Evstigney.... [Yawns] He comes. "What's this," I say, "Evstigney, you<br>
        old fool."... [Looks at ANYA] Anya dear! [Pause] She's dropped off....<br>
        [Takes ANYA'S arm] Let's go to bye-bye.... Come along!... [Leads her] My<br>
        darling's gone to sleep! Come on.... [They go. In the distance, the<br>
        other side of the orchard, a shepherd plays his pipe. TROFIMOV crosses<br>
        the stage and stops on seeing VARYA and ANYA] Sh! She's asleep, asleep.<br>
        Come on, dear.</a><br>
<a name=1.1.221><b>ANYA.</b> [Quietly, half-asleep] I'm so tired... all the bells... uncle,<br>

<h3>ACT TWO</h3>
<p>[In a field. An old, crooked shrine, which has been long abandoned; near<br>
        it a well and large stones, which apparently are old tombstones, and an<br>
        old garden seat. The road is seen to GAEV'S estate. On one side rise<br>
        dark poplars, behind them begins the cherry orchard. In the distance is<br>
        a row of telegraph poles, and far, far away on the horizon are the<br>
        indistinct signs of a large town, which can only be seen on the finest<br>
        and clearest days. It is close on sunset. CHARLOTTA, YASHA, and DUNYASHA<br>
        are sitting on the seat; EPIKHODOV stands by and plays on a guitar; all<br>
        seem thoughtful. CHARLOTTA wears a man's old peaked cap; she has unslung<br>
        a rifle from her shoulders and is putting to rights the buckle on the<br>
        strap.]</p>
<a name=1.2.224><b>CHARLOTTA.</b> [Thoughtfully] I haven't a real passport. I don't know how<br>
        old I am, and I think I'm young. When I was a little girl my father and<br>
        mother used to go round fairs and give very good performances and I used<br>
        to do thesalto mortaleand various little things. And when papa<br>
        and mamma died a German lady took me to her and began to teach me. I<br>
        liked it. I grew up and became a governess. And where I came from and<br>
        who I am, I don't know.... Who my parents were&mdash;perhaps they<br>
        weren't married&mdash;I don't know. [Takes a cucumber out of her pocket<br>
        and eats] I don't know anything. [Pause] I do want to talk, but I<br>
        haven't anybody to talk to... I haven't anybody at all.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.225><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> [Plays on the guitar and sings]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.226><b>DUNYASHA.</b> That's a guitar, not a mandoline. [Looks at herself in a<br>
        little mirror and powders herself.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.227><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> For the enamoured madman, this is a mandoline. [Sings]</a><br>
<p>[YASHA sings too.]</p>
<a name=1.2.228><b>CHARLOTTA.</b> These people sing terribly.... Foo! Like jackals.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.229><b>DUNYASHA.</b> [To YASHA] Still, it must be nice to live abroad.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.230><b>YASHA.</b> Yes, certainly. I cannot differ from you there. [Yawns and lights<br>
        a cigar.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.231><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> That is perfectly natural. Abroad everything is in full<br>
        complexity.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.232><b>YASHA.</b> That goes without saying.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.233><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> I'm an educated man, I read various remarkable books, but I<br>
        cannot understand the direction I myself want to go&mdash;whether to<br>
        live or to shoot myself, as it were. So, in case, I always carry a<br>
        revolver about with me. Here it is. [Shows a revolver.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.234><b>CHARLOTTA.</b> I've done. Now I'll go. [Slings the rifle] You, Epikhodov,<br>
        are a very clever man and very terrible; women must be madly in love<br>
        with you. Brrr! [Going] These wise ones are all so stupid. I've nobody<br>
        to talk to. I'm always alone, alone; I've nobody at all... and I don't<br>
        know who I am or why I live. [Exit slowly.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.235><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> As a matter of fact, independently of everything else, I must<br>
        express my feeling, among other things, that fate has been as pitiless<br>
        in her dealings with me as a storm is to a small ship. Suppose, let us<br>
        grant, I am wrong; then why did I wake up this morning, to give an<br>
        example, and behold an enormous spider on my chest, like that. [Shows<br>
        with both hands] And if I do drink some kvass, why is it that there is<br>
        bound to be something of the most indelicate nature in it, such as a<br>
        beetle? [Pause] Have you read Buckle? [Pause] I should like to trouble<br>
        you, Avdotya Fedorovna, for two words.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.236><b>DUNYASHA.</b> Say on.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.237><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> I should prefer to be alone with you. [Sighs.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.238><b>DUNYASHA.</b> [Shy] Very well, only first bring me my little cloak.... It's<br>
        by the cupboard. It's a little damp here.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.239><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> Very well... I'll bring it.... Now I know what to do with my<br>
        revolver. [Takes guitar and exits, strumming.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.240><b>YASHA.</b> Two-and-twenty troubles! A silly man, between you and me and the<br>
        gatepost. [Yawns.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.241><b>DUNYASHA.</b> I hope to goodness he won't shoot himself. [Pause] I'm so<br>
        nervous, I'm worried. I went into service when I was quite a little<br>
        girl, and now I'm not used to common life, and my hands are white, white<br>
        as a lady's. I'm so tender and so delicate now; respectable and afraid<br>
        of everything.... I'm so frightened. And I don't know what will happen<br>
        to my nerves if you deceive me, Yasha.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.242><b>YASHA.</b> [Kisses her] Little cucumber! Of course, every girl must respect<br>
        herself; there's nothing I dislike more than a badly behaved girl.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.243><b>DUNYASHA.</b> I'm awfully in love with you; you're educated, you can talk<br>
        about everything. [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.244><b>YASHA.</b> [Yawns] Yes. I think this: if a girl loves anybody, then that<br>
        means she's immoral. [Pause] It's nice to smoke a cigar out in the open<br>
        air.... [Listens] Somebody's coming. It's the mistress, and people with<br>
        her. [DUNYASHA embraces him suddenly] Go to the house, as if you'd been<br>
        bathing in the river; go by this path, or they'll meet you and will<br>
        think I've been meeting you. I can't stand that sort of thing.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.245><b>DUNYASHA.</b> [Coughs quietly] My head's aching because of your cigar.</a><br>
<p>[Exit. YASHA remains, sitting by the shrine. Enter LUBOV ANDREYEVNA,<br>
        GAEV, and LOPAKHIN.]</p>
<a name=1.2.246><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> You must make up your mind definitely&mdash;there's no time to<br>
        waste. The question is perfectly plain. Are you willing to let the land<br>
        for villas or no? Just one word, yes or no? Just one word!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.247><b>LUBOV.</b> Who's smoking horrible cigars here? [Sits.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.248><b>GAEV.</b> They built that railway; that's made this place very handy. [Sits]<br>
        Went to town and had lunch... red in the middle! I'd like to go in now<br>
        and have just one game.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.249><b>LUBOV.</b> You'll have time.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.250><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Just one word! [Imploringly] Give me an answer!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.251><b>GAEV.</b> [Yawns] Really!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.252><b>LUBOV.</b> [Looks in her purse] I had a lot of money yesterday, but there's<br>
        very little to-day. My poor Varya feeds everybody on milk soup to save<br>
        money, in the kitchen the old people only get peas, and I spend<br>
        recklessly. [Drops the purse, scattering gold coins] There, they are all<br>
        over the place.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.253><b>YASHA.</b> Permit me to pick them up. [Collects the coins.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.254><b>LUBOV.</b> Please do, Yasha. And why did I go and have lunch there?... A<br>
        horrid restaurant with band and tablecloths smelling of soap.... Why do<br>
        you drink so much, Leon? Why do you eat so much? Why do you talk so<br>
        much? You talked again too much to-day in the restaurant, and it wasn't<br>
        at all to the point&mdash;about the seventies and about decadents. And<br>
        to whom? Talking to the waiters about decadents!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.255><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Yes.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.256><b>GAEV.</b> [Waves his hand] I can't be cured, that's obvious.... [Irritably<br>
        to YASHA] What's the matter? Why do you keep twisting about in front of<br>
        me?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.257><b>YASHA.</b> [Laughs] I can't listen to your voice without laughing.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.258><b>GAEV.</b> [To his sister] Either he or I...</a><br>
<a name=1.2.259><b>LUBOV.</b> Go away, Yasha; get out of this....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.260><b>YASHA.</b> [Gives purse to LUBOV ANDREYEVNA] I'll go at once. [Hardly able<br>
        to keep from laughing] This minute.... [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.261><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> That rich man Deriganov is preparing to buy your estate. They<br>
        say he'll come to the sale himself.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.262><b>LUBOV.</b> Where did you hear that?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.263><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> They say so in town.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.264><b>GAEV.</b> Our Yaroslav aunt has promised to send something, but I don't know<br>
        when or how much.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.265><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> How much will she send? A hundred thousand roubles? Or two,<br>
        perhaps?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.266><b>LUBOV.</b> I'd be glad of ten or fifteen thousand.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.267><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> You must excuse my saying so, but I've never met such<br>
        frivolous people as you before, or anybody so unbusinesslike and<br>
        peculiar. Here I am telling you in plain language that your estate will<br>
        be sold, and you don't seem to understand.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.268><b>LUBOV.</b> What are we to do? Tell us, what?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.269><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I tell you every day. I say the same thing every day. Both the<br>
        cherry orchard and the land must be leased off for villas and at once,<br>
        immediately&mdash;the auction is staring you in the face: Understand!<br>
        Once you do definitely make up your minds to the villas, then you'll<br>
        have as much money as you want and you'll be saved.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.270><b>LUBOV.</b> Villas and villa residents&mdash;it's so vulgar, excuse me.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.271><b>GAEV.</b> I entirely agree with you.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.272><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I must cry or yell or faint. I can't stand it! You're too much<br>
        for me! [To GAEV] You old woman!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.273><b>GAEV.</b> Really!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.274><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Old woman! [Going out.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.275><b>LUBOV.</b> [Frightened] No, don't go away, do stop; be a dear. Please.<br>
        Perhaps we'll find some way out!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.276><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> What's the good of trying to think!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.277><b>LUBOV.</b> Please don't go away. It's nicer when you're here.... [Pause] I<br>
        keep on waiting for something to happen, as if the house is going to<br>
        collapse over our heads.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.278><b>GAEV.</b> [Thinking deeply] Double in the corner... across the middle....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.279><b>LUBOV.</b> We have been too sinful....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.280><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> What sins have you committed?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.281><b>GAEV.</b> [Puts candy into his mouth] They say that I've eaten all my<br>
        substance in sugar-candies. [Laughs.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.282><b>LUBOV.</b> Oh, my sins.... I've always scattered money about without holding<br>
        myself in, like a madwoman, and I married a man who made nothing but<br>
        debts. My husband died of champagne&mdash;he drank terribly&mdash;and to<br>
        my misfortune, I fell in love with another man and went off with him,<br>
        and just at that time&mdash;it was my first punishment, a blow that hit<br>
        me right on the head&mdash;here, in the river... my boy was drowned, and<br>
        I went away, quite away, never to return, never to see this river<br>
        again...I shut my eyes and ran without thinking, butheran after<br>
        me... without pity, without respect. I bought a villa near Mentone<br>
        becausehefell ill there, and for three years I knew no rest<br>
        either by day or night; the sick man wore me out, and my soul dried up.<br>
        And last year, when they had sold the villa to pay my debts, I went away<br>
        to Paris, and there he robbed me of all I had and threw me over and went<br>
        off with another woman. I tried to poison myself.... It was so silly, so<br>
        shameful.... And suddenly I longed to be back in Russia, my own land,<br>
        with my little girl.... [Wipes her tears] Lord, Lord be merciful to me,<br>
        forgive me my sins! Punish me no more! [Takes a telegram out of her<br>
        pocket] I had this to-day from Paris.... He begs my forgiveness, he<br>
        implores me to return.... [Tears it up] Don't I hear music? [Listens.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.283><b>GAEV.</b> That is our celebrated Jewish band. You remember&mdash;four<br>
        violins, a flute, and a double-bass.</a><br>
<p>LUBOV So it still exists? It would be nice if they came along some<br>
        evening.</p>
<a name=1.2.284><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Listens] I can't hear.... [Sings quietly] "For money will the<br>
        Germans make a Frenchman of a Russian." [Laughs] I saw such an awfully<br>
        funny thing at the theatre last night.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.285><b>LUBOV.</b> I'm quite sure there wasn't anything at all funny. You oughtn't<br>
        to go and see plays, you ought to go and look at yourself. What a grey<br>
        life you lead, what a lot you talk unnecessarily.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.286><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> It's true. To speak the straight truth, we live a silly life.<br>
        [Pause] My father was a peasant, an idiot, he understood nothing, he<br>
        didn't teach me, he was always drunk, and always used a stick on me. In<br>
        point of fact, I'm a fool and an idiot too. I've never learned anything,<br>
        my handwriting is bad, I write so that I'm quite ashamed before people,<br>
        like a pig!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.287><b>LUBOV.</b> You ought to get married, my friend.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.288><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Yes... that's true.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.289><b>LUBOV.</b> Why not to our Varya? She's a nice girl.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.290><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Yes.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.291><b>LUBOV.</b> She's quite homely in her ways, works all day, and, what matters<br>
        most, she's in love with you. And you've liked her for a long time.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.292><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Well? I don't mind... she's a nice girl. [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.293><b>GAEV.</b> I'm offered a place in a bank. Six thousand roubles a year.... Did<br>
        you hear?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.294><b>LUBOV.</b> What's the matter with you! Stay where you are....</a><br>
<p>[Enter FIERS with an overcoat.]</p>
<a name=1.2.295><b>FIERS.</b> [To GAEV] Please, sir, put this on, it's damp.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.296><b>GAEV.</b> [Putting it on] You're a nuisance, old man.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.297><b>FIERS.</b> It's all very well.... You went away this morning without telling<br>
        me. [Examining GAEV.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.298><b>LUBOV.</b> How old you've grown, Fiers!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.299><b>FIERS.</b> I beg your pardon?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.300><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> She says you've grown very old!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.301><b>FIERS.</b> I've been alive a long time. They were already getting ready to<br>
        marry me before your father was born.... [Laughs] And when the<br>
        Emancipation came I was already first valet. Only I didn't agree with<br>
        the Emancipation and remained with my people.... [Pause] I remember<br>
        everybody was happy, but they didn't know why.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.302><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> It was very good for them in the old days. At any rate, they<br>
        used to beat them.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.303><b>FIERS.</b> [Not hearing] Rather. The peasants kept their distance from the<br>
        masters and the masters kept their distance from the peasants, but now<br>
        everything's all anyhow and you can't understand anything.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.304><b>GAEV.</b> Be quiet, Fiers. I've got to go to town tomorrow. I've been<br>
        promised an introduction to a General who may lend me money on a bill.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.305><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Nothing will come of it. And you won't pay your interest,<br>
        don't you worry.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.306><b>LUBOV.</b> He's talking rubbish. There's no General at all.</a><br>

        [All sit down.]</a><br>

<a name=1.2.316><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Laughs] I wonder what you think of me?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.317><b>TROFIMOV.</b> I think, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that you're a rich man, and<br>
        you'll soon be a millionaire. Just as the wild beast which eats<br>
        everything it finds is needed for changes to take place in matter, so<br>
        you are needed too.</a><br>
<p>[All laugh.]</p>
<a name=1.2.318><b>VARYA.</b> Better tell us something about the planets, Peter.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.319><b>LUBOV ANDREYEVNA.</b> No, let's go on with yesterday's talk!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.320><b>TROFIMOV.</b> About what?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.321><b>GAEV.</b> About the proud man.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.322><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Yesterday we talked for a long time but we didn't come to<br>
        anything in the end. There's something mystical about the proud man, in<br>
        your sense. Perhaps you are right from your point of view, but if you<br>
        take the matter simply, without complicating it, then what pride can<br>
        there be, what sense can there be in it, if a man is imperfectly made,<br>
        physiologically speaking, if in the vast majority of cases he is coarse<br>
        and stupid and deeply unhappy? We must stop admiring one another. We<br>
        must work, nothing more.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.323><b>GAEV.</b> You'll die, all the same.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.324><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Who knows? And what does it mean&mdash;you'll die? Perhaps a<br>
        man has a hundred senses, and when he dies only the five known to us are<br>
        destroyed and the remaining ninety-five are left alive.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.325><b>LUBOV.</b> How clever of you, Peter!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.326><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Ironically] Oh, awfully!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.327><b>TROFIMOV.</b> The human race progresses, perfecting its powers. Everything<br>
        that is unattainable now will some day be near at hand and<br>
        comprehensible, but we must work, we must help with all our strength<br>
        those who seek to know what fate will bring. Meanwhile in Russia only a<br>
        very few of us work. The vast majority of those intellectuals whom I<br>
        know seek for nothing, do nothing, and are at present incapable of hard<br>
        work. They call themselves intellectuals, but they use "thou" and "thee"<br>
        to their servants, they treat the peasants like animals, they learn<br>
        badly, they read nothing seriously, they do absolutely nothing, about<br>
        science they only talk, about art they understand little. They are all<br>
        serious, they all have severe faces, they all talk about important<br>
        things. They philosophize, and at the same time, the vast majority of<br>
        us, ninety-nine out of a hundred, live like savages, fighting and<br>
        cursing at the slightest opportunity, eating filthily, sleeping in the<br>
        dirt, in stuffiness, with fleas, stinks, smells, moral filth, and so<br>
        on... And it's obvious that all our nice talk is only carried on to<br>
        distract ourselves and others. Tell me, where are those crÈches we hear<br>
        so much of? and where are those reading-rooms? People only write novels<br>
        about them; they don't really exist. Only dirt, vulgarity, and Asiatic<br>
        plagues really exist.... I'm afraid, and I don't at all like serious<br>
        faces; I don't like serious conversations. Let's be quiet sooner.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.328><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> You know, I get up at five every morning, I work from morning<br>
        till evening, I am always dealing with money&mdash;my own and other<br>
        people's&mdash;and I see what people are like. You've only got to begin<br>
        to do anything to find out how few honest, honourable people there are.<br>
        Sometimes, when I can't sleep, I think: "Oh Lord, you've given us huge<br>
        forests, infinite fields, and endless horizons, and we, living here,<br>
        ought really to be giants."</a><br>
<a name=1.2.329><b>LUBOV.</b> You want giants, do you?... They're only good in stories, and<br>
        even there they frighten one. [EPIKHODOV enters at the back of the stage<br>

<a name=1.2.338><b>LUBOV.</b> What's that?</a><br>
<a name=1.2.339><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I don't know. It may be a bucket fallen down a well somewhere.<br>
        But it's some way off.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.340><b>GAEV.</b> Or perhaps it's some bird... like a heron.</a><br>

<a name=1.2.342><b>LUBOV.</b> [Shudders] It's unpleasant, somehow. [A pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.2.343><b>FIERS.</b> Before the misfortune the same thing happened. An owl screamed<br>

        now.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.367><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Varya's afraid we may fall in love with each other and won't<br>
        get away from us for days on end. Her narrow mind won't allow her to<br>
        understand that we are above love. To escape all the petty and deceptive<br>
        things which prevent our being happy and free, that is the aim and<br>
        meaning of our lives. Forward! We go irresistibly on to that bright star<br>
        which burns there, in the distance! Don't lag behind, friends!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.368><b>ANYA.</b> [Clapping her hands] How beautifully you talk! [Pause] It is<br>

<a name=1.2.369><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Yes, the weather is wonderful.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.370><b>ANYA.</b> What have you done to me, Peter? I don't love the cherry orchard<br>
        as I used to. I loved it so tenderly, I thought there was no better<br>
        place in the world than our orchard.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.371><b>TROFIMOV.</b> All Russia is our orchard. The land is great and beautiful,<br>
        there are many marvellous places in it. [Pause] Think, Anya, your<br>
        grandfather, your great-grandfather, and all your ancestors were<br>
        serf-owners, they owned living souls; and now, doesn't something human<br>
        look at you from every cherry in the orchard, every leaf and every<br>
        stalk? Don't you hear voices...? Oh, it's awful, your orchard is<br>
        terrible; and when in the evening or at night you walk through the<br>
        orchard, then the old bark on the trees sheds a dim light and the old<br>
        cherry-trees seem to be dreaming of all that was a hundred, two hundred<br>
        years ago, and are oppressed by their heavy visions. Still, at any rate,<br>
        we've left those two hundred years behind us. So far we've gained<br>
        nothing at all&mdash;we don't yet know what the past is to be to us&mdash;we<br>
        only philosophize, we complain that we are dull, or we drink vodka. For<br>
        it's so clear that in order to begin to live in the present we must<br>
        first redeem the past, and that can only be done by suffering, by<br>
        strenuous, uninterrupted labour. Understand that, Anya.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.372><b>ANYA.</b> The house in which we live has long ceased to be our house; I<br>
        shall go away. I give you my word.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.373><b>TROFIMOV.</b> If you have the housekeeping keys, throw them down the well<br>
        and go away. Be as free as the wind.</a><br>
<a name=1.2.374><b>ANYA.</b> [Enthusiastically] How nicely you said that!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.375><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Believe me, Anya, believe me! I'm not thirty yet, I'm young,<br>
        I'm still a student, but I have undergone a great deal! I'm as hungry as<br>
        the winter, I'm ill, I'm shaken. I'm as poor as a beggar, and where<br>
        haven't I been&mdash;fate has tossed me everywhere! But my soul is<br>
        always my own; every minute of the day and the night it is filled with<br>
        unspeakable presentiments. I know that happiness is coming, Anya, I see<br>
        it already....</a><br>
<a name=1.2.376><b>ANYA.</b> [Thoughtful] The moon is rising.</a><br>
<p>[EPIKHODOV is heard playing the same sad song on his guitar. The moon<br>

        "Anya, where are you?"]</p>
<a name=1.2.377><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Yes, the moon has risen. [Pause] There is happiness, there it<br>
        comes; it comes nearer and nearer; I hear its steps already. And if we<br>
        do not see it we shall not know it, but what does that matter? Others<br>
        will see it!</a><br>
<a name=1.2.378><b>THE VOICE OF VARYA.</b> Anya! Where are you?</a><br>

<h3>ACT THREE</h3>
<p>[A reception-room cut off from a drawing-room by an arch. Chandelier<br>
        lighted. A Jewish band, the one mentioned in Act II, is heard playing in<br>
        another room. Evening. In the drawing-room the grand rond is being<br>
        danced. Voice of SIMEONOV PISCHIN "Promenade a une paire!" Dancers come<br>
        into the reception-room; the first pair are PISCHIN and CHARLOTTA<br>
        IVANOVNA; the second, TROFIMOV and LUBOV ANDREYEVNA; the third, ANYA and<br>
        the POST OFFICE CLERK; the fourth, VARYA and the STATION-MASTER, and so<br>
        on. VARYA is crying gently and wipes away her tears as she dances.<br>
        DUNYASHA is in the last pair. They go off into the drawing-room, PISCHIN<br>
        shouting, "Grand rond, balancez:" and "Les cavaliers ‡ genou et<br>
        remerciez vos dames!" FIERS, in a dress-coat, carries a tray with<br>
        seltzer-water across. Enter PISCHIN and TROFIMOV from the drawing-room.]</p>
<a name=1.3.383><b>PISCHIN.</b> I'm full-blooded and have already had two strokes; it's hard<br>
        for me to dance, but, as they say, if you're in Rome, you must do as<br>
        Rome does. I've got the strength of a horse. My dead father, who liked a<br>
        joke, peace to his bones, used to say, talking of our ancestors, that<br>
        the ancient stock of the Simeonov-Pischins was descended from that<br>
        identical horse that Caligula made a senator.... [Sits] But the trouble<br>
        is, I've no money! A hungry dog only believes in meat. [Snores and wakes<br>

<a name=1.3.390><b>TROFIMOV.</b> [To PISCHIN] If the energy which you, in the course of your<br>

<a name=1.3.422><b>LUBOV.</b> Grandmother sent fifteen thousand roubles from Yaroslav to buy<br>

<a name=1.3.426><b>VARYA.</b> I do look at the matter seriously, little mother, to be quite<br>

<a name=1.3.428><b>VARYA.</b> I can't propose to him myself, little mother. People have been<br>

        or jokes about it. I understand. He's getting rich, he's busy, he can't<br>
        bother about me. If I had some money, even a little, even only a hundred<br>

<a name=1.3.430><b>VARYA.</b> [To TROFIMOV] A student ought to have sense! [Gently, in tears]<br>
        How ugly you are now, Peter, how old you've grown! [To LUBOV ANDREYEVNA,<br>
        no longer crying] But I can't go on without working, little mother. I<br>
        want to be doing something every minute.</a><br>
<p>[Enter YASHA.]</p>
<a name=1.3.431><b>YASHA.</b> [Nearly laughing] Epikhodov's broken a billiard cue! [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.432><b>VARYA.</b> Why is Epikhodov here? Who said he could play billiards? I don't<br>
        understand these people. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.433><b>LUBOV.</b> Don't tease her, Peter, you see that she's quite unhappy without<br>
        that.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.434><b>TROFIMOV.</b> She takes too much on herself, she keeps on interfering in<br>
        other people's business. The whole summer she's given no peace to me or<br>
        to Anya, she's afraid we'll have a romance all to ourselves. What has it<br>
        to do with her? As if I'd ever given her grounds to believe I'd stoop to<br>
        such vulgarity! We are above love.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.435><b>LUBOV.</b> Then I suppose I must be beneath love. [In agitation] Why isn't<br>
        Leonid here? If I only knew whether the estate is sold or not! The<br>
        disaster seems to me so improbable that I don't know what to think, I'm<br>
        all at sea... I may scream... or do something silly. Save me, Peter. Say<br>
        something, say something.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.436><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Isn't it all the same whether the estate is sold to-day or<br>
        isn't? It's been all up with it for a long time; there's no turning<br>
        back, the path's grown over. Be calm, dear, you shouldn't deceive<br>
        yourself, for once in your life at any rate you must look the truth<br>
        straight in the face.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.437><b>LUBOV.</b> What truth? You see where truth is, and where untruth is, but I<br>
        seem to have lost my sight and see nothing. You boldly settle all<br>
        important questions, but tell me, dear, isn't it because you're young,<br>
        because you haven't had time to suffer till you settled a single one of<br>
        your questions? You boldly look forward, isn't it because you cannot<br>
        foresee or expect anything terrible, because so far life has been hidden<br>
        from your young eyes? You are bolder, more honest, deeper than we are,<br>
        but think only, be just a little magnanimous, and have mercy on me. I<br>
        was born here, my father and mother lived here, my grandfather too, I<br>
        love this house. I couldn't understand my life without that cherry<br>
        orchard, and if it really must be sold, sell me with it! [Embraces<br>
        TROFIMOV, kisses his forehead]. My son was drowned here.... [Weeps] Have<br>
        pity on me, good, kind man.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.438><b>TROFIMOV.</b> You know I sympathize with all my soul.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.439><b>LUBOV.</b> Yes, but it ought to be said differently, differently.... [Takes<br>
        another handkerchief, a telegram falls on the floor] I'm so sick at<br>
        heart to-day, you can't imagine. Here it's so noisy, my soul shakes at<br>
        every sound. I shake all over, and I can't go away by myself, I'm afraid<br>
        of the silence. Don't judge me harshly, Peter... I loved you, as if you<br>
        belonged to my family. I'd gladly let Anya marry you, I swear it, only<br>
        dear, you ought to work, finish your studies. You don't do anything,<br>
        only fate throws you about from place to place, it's so odd.... Isn't it<br>
        true? Yes? And you ought to do something to your beard to make it grow<br>
        better [Laughs] You are funny!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.440><b>TROFIMOV.</b> [Picking up telegram] I don't want to be a Beau Brummel.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.441><b>LUBOV.</b> This telegram's from Paris. I get one every day. Yesterday and<br>
        to-day. That wild man is ill again, he's bad again.... He begs for<br>
        forgiveness, and implores me to come, and I really ought to go to Paris<br>
        to be near him. You look severe, Peter, but what can I do, my dear, what<br>
        can I do; he's ill, he's alone, unhappy, and who's to look after him,<br>
        who's to keep him away from his errors, to give him his medicine<br>
        punctually? And why should I conceal it and say nothing about it; I love<br>
        him, that's plain, I love him, I love him.... That love is a stone round<br>
        my neck; I'm going with it to the bottom, but I love that stone and<br>
        can't live without it. [Squeezes TROFIMOV'S hand] Don't think badly of<br>
        me, Peter, don't say anything to me, don't say...</a><br>
<a name=1.3.442><b>TROFIMOV.</b> [Weeping] For God's sake forgive my speaking candidly, but<br>
        that man has robbed you!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.443><b>LUBOV.</b> No, no, no, you oughtn't to say that! [Stops her ears.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.444><b>TROFIMOV.</b> But he's a wretch, you alone don't know it! He's a petty<br>
        thief, a nobody....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.445><b>LUBOV.</b> [Angry, but restrained] You're twenty-six or twenty-seven, and<br>
        still a schoolboy of the second class!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.446><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Why not!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.447><b>LUBOV.</b> You ought to be a man, at your age you ought to be able to<br>
        understand those who love. And you ought to be in love yourself, you<br>
        must fall in love! [Angry] Yes, yes! You aren't pure, you're just a<br>
        freak, a queer fellow, a funny growth...</a><br>
<a name=1.3.448><b>TROFIMOV.</b> [In horror] What is she saying!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.449><b>LUBOV.</b> "I'm above love!" You're not above love, you're just what our<br>
        Fiers calls a bungler. Not to have a mistress at your age!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.450><b>TROFIMOV.</b> [In horror] This is awful! What is she saying? [Goes quickly<br>
        up into the drawing-room, clutching his head] It's awful... I can't<br>
        stand it, I'll go away. [Exit, but returns at once] All is over between<br>
        us! [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.451><b>LUBOV.</b> [Shouts after him] Peter, wait! Silly man, I was joking! Peter!<br>
        [Somebody is heard going out and falling downstairs noisily. ANYA and<br>
        VARYA scream; laughter is heard immediately] What's that?</a><br>
<p>[ANYA comes running in, laughing.]</p>
<a name=1.3.452><b>ANYA.</b> Peter's fallen downstairs! [Runs out again.]</a><br>

<p>[The STATION-MASTER stands in the middle of the drawing-room and recites<br>
        "The Magdalen" by Tolstoy. He is listened to, but he has only delivered<br>
        a few lines when a waltz is heard from the front room, and the<br>
        recitation is stopped. Everybody dances. TROFIMOV, ANYA, VARYA, and<br>

<a name=1.3.454><b>LUBOV.</b> Well, Peter... you pure soul... I beg your pardon... let's dance.</a><br>
<p>[She dances with PETER. ANYA and VARYA dance. FIERS enters and stands<br>
        his stick by a side door. YASHA has also come in and looks on at the<br>
        dance.]</p>
<a name=1.3.455><b>YASHA.</b> Well, grandfather?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.456><b>FIERS.</b> I'm not well. At our balls some time back, generals and barons<br>
        and admirals used to dance, and now we send for post-office clerks and<br>
        the Station-master, and even they come as a favour. I'm very weak. The<br>
        dead master, the grandfather, used to give everybody sealing-wax when<br>
        anything was wrong. I've taken sealing-wax every day for twenty years,<br>
        and more; perhaps that's why I still live.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.457><b>YASHA.</b> I'm tired of you, grandfather. [Yawns] If you'd only hurry up and<br>
        kick the bucket.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.458><b>FIERS.</b> Oh you... bungler! [Mutters.]</a><br>
<p>[TROFIMOV and LUBOV ANDREYEVNA dance in the reception-room, then into<br>
        the sitting-room.]</p>
<a name=1.3.459><b>LUBOV.</b>Merci. I'll sit down. [Sits] I'm tired.</a><br>
<p>[Enter ANYA.]</p>
<a name=1.3.460><b>ANYA.</b> [Excited] Somebody in the kitchen was saying just now that the<br>
        cherry orchard was sold to-day.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.461><b>LUBOV.</b> Sold to whom?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.462><b>ANYA.</b> He didn't say to whom. He's gone now. [Dances out into the<br>
        reception-room with TROFIMOV.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.463><b>YASHA.</b> Some old man was chattering about it a long time ago. A stranger!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.464><b>FIERS.</b> And Leonid Andreyevitch isn't here yet, he hasn't come. He's<br>
        wearing a light,demi-saisonovercoat. He'll catch cold. Oh these<br>
        young fellows.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.465><b>LUBOV.</b> I'll die of this. Go and find out, Yasha, to whom it's sold.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.466><b>YASHA.</b> Oh, but he's been gone a long time, the old man. [Laughs.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.467><b>LUBOV.</b> [Slightly vexed] Why do you laugh? What are you glad about?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.468><b>YASHA.</b> Epikhodov's too funny. He's a silly man. Two-and-twenty troubles.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.469><b>LUBOV.</b> Fiers, if the estate is sold, where will you go?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.470><b>FIERS.</b> I'll go wherever you order me to go.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.471><b>LUBOV.</b> Why do you look like that? Are you ill? I think you ought to go<br>
        to bed....</a><br>
<a name=1.3.472><b>FIERS.</b> Yes... [With a smile] I'll go to bed, and who'll hand things<br>
        round and give orders without me? I've the whole house on my shoulders.</a><br>
<a name=1.3.473><b>YASHA.</b> [To LUBOV ANDREYEVNA] Lubov Andreyevna! I want to ask a favour of<br>
        you, if you'll be so kind! If you go to Paris again, then please take me<br>
        with you. It's absolutely impossible for me to stop here. [Looking<br>
        round; in an undertone] What's the good of talking about it, you see for<br>
        yourself that this is an uneducated country, with an immoral population,<br>
        and it's so dull. The food in the kitchen is beastly, and here's this<br>
        Fiers walking about mumbling various inappropriate things. Take me with<br>
        you, be so kind!</a><br>
<p>[Enter PISCHIN.]</p>
<a name=1.3.474><b>PISCHIN.</b> I come to ask for the pleasure of a little waltz, dear lady....<br>
        [LUBOV ANDREYEVNA goes to him] But all the same, you wonderful woman, I<br>
        must have 180 little roubles from you... I must.... [They dance] 180<br>
        little roubles.... [They go through into the drawing-room.]</a><br>
<p>[In the drawing-room a figure in a grey top-hat and in baggy check<br>
        trousers is waving its hands and jumping about; there are cries of<br>
        "Bravo, Charlotta Ivanovna!"]</p>
<a name=1.3.475><b>DUNYASHA.</b> [Stops to powder her face] The young mistress tells me to<br>

        the Post-office clerk told me something just now which made me catch my<br>
        breath. [The music grows faint.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.476><b>FIERS.</b> What did he say to you?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.477><b>DUNYASHA.</b> He says, "You're like a little flower."</a><br>

<a name=1.3.482><b>DUNYASHA.</b> What do you want?</a><br>
<a name=1.3.483><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> Undoubtedly, perhaps, you may be right. [Sighs] But,<br>
        certainly, if you regard the matter from the aspect, then you, if I may<br>
        say so, and you must excuse my candidness, have absolutely reduced me to<br>
        a state of mind. I know my fate, every day something unfortunate happens<br>
        to me, and I've grown used to it a long time ago, I even look at my fate<br>
        with a smile. You gave me your word, and though I...</a><br>
<a name=1.3.484><b>DUNYASHA.</b> Please, we'll talk later on, but leave me alone now. I'm<br>

<a name=1.3.488><b>VARYA.</b> I'm not calling you to order, I'm only telling you. You just walk<br>

<a name=1.3.510><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I bought it.</a><br>
<p>[LUBOV ANDREYEVNA is overwhelmed; she would fall if she were not<br>
        standing by an armchair and a table. VARYA takes her keys off her belt,<br>
        throws them on the floor, into the middle of the room and goes out.]</p>
<a name=1.3.511><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I bought it! Wait, ladies and gentlemen, please, my head's<br>
        going round, I can't talk.... [Laughs] When we got to the sale,<br>
        Deriganov was there already. Leonid Andreyevitch had only fifteen<br>
        thousand roubles, and Deriganov offered thirty thousand on top of the<br>
        mortgage to begin with. I saw how matters were, so I grabbed hold of him<br>
        and bid forty. He went up to forty-five, I offered fifty-five. That<br>
        means he went up by fives and I went up by tens.... Well, it came to an<br>
        end. I bid ninety more than the mortgage; and it stayed with me. The<br>
        cherry orchard is mine now, mine! [Roars with laughter] My God, my God,<br>
        the cherry orchard's mine! Tell me I'm drunk, or mad, or dreaming....<br>
        [Stamps his feet] Don't laugh at me! If my father and grandfather rose<br>
        from their graves and looked at the whole affair, and saw how their<br>
        Ermolai, their beaten and uneducated Ermolai, who used to run barefoot<br>
        in the winter, how that very Ermolai has bought an estate, which is the<br>
        most beautiful thing in the world! I've bought the estate where my<br>
        grandfather and my father were slaves, where they weren't even allowed<br>
        into the kitchen. I'm asleep, it's only a dream, an illusion.... It's<br>
        the fruit of imagination, wrapped in the fog of the unknown.... [Picks<br>
        up the keys, nicely smiling] She threw down the keys, she wanted to show<br>
        she was no longer mistress here.... [Jingles keys] Well, it's all one!<br>
        [Hears the band tuning up] Eh, musicians, play, I want to hear you! Come<br>
        and look at Ermolai Lopakhin laying his axe to the cherry orchard, come<br>
        and look at the trees falling! We'll build villas here, and our<br>
        grandsons and great-grandsons will see a new life here.... Play on,<br>
        music! [The band plays. LUBOV ANDREYEVNA sinks into a chair and weeps<br>
        bitterly. LOPAKHIN continues reproachfully] Why then, why didn't you<br>
        take my advice? My poor, dear woman, you can't go back now. [Weeps] Oh,<br>
        if only the whole thing was done with, if only our uneven, unhappy life<br>
        were changed!</a><br>
<a name=1.3.512><b>PISCHIN.</b> [Takes his arm; in an undertone] She's crying. Let's go into<br>

        and leads him out.]</a><br>
<a name=1.3.513><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> What's that? Bandsmen, play nicely! Go on, do just as I want<br>
        you to! [Ironically] The new owner, the owner of the cherry orchard is<br>
        coming! [He accidentally knocks up against a little table and nearly<br>
        upsets the candelabra] I can pay for everything! [Exit with PISCHIN]</a><br>
<p>[In the reception-room and the drawing-room nobody remains except LUBOV<br>
        ANDREYEVNA, who sits huddled up and weeping bitterly. The band plays<br>
        softly. ANYA and TROFIMOV come in quickly. ANYA goes up to her mother<br>
        and goes on her knees in front of her. TROFIMOV stands at the<br>
        drawing-room entrance.]</p>
<a name=1.3.514><b>ANYA.</b> Mother! mother, are you crying? My dear, kind, good mother, my<br>
        beautiful mother, I love you! Bless you! The cherry orchard is sold,<br>
        we've got it no longer, it's true, true, but don't cry mother, you've<br>
        still got your life before you, you've still your beautiful pure soul...<br>
        Come with me, come, dear, away from here, come! We'll plant a new<br>
        garden, finer than this, and you'll see it, and you'll understand, and<br>
        deep joy, gentle joy will sink into your soul, like the evening sun, and<br>
        you'll smile, mother! Come, dear, let's go!</a><br>

<h3>ACT FOUR</h3>
<p>[The stage is set as for Act I. There are no curtains on the windows, no<br>
        pictures; only a few pieces of furniture are left; they are piled up in<br>
        a corner as if for sale. The emptiness is felt. By the door that leads<br>
        out of the house and at the back of the stage, portmanteaux and<br>
        travelling paraphernalia are piled up. The door on the left is open; the<br>
        voices of VARYA and ANYA can be heard through it. LOPAKHIN stands and<br>
        waits. YASHA holds a tray with little tumblers of champagne. Outside,<br>
        EPIKHODOV is tying up a box. Voices are heard behind the stage. The<br>
        peasants have come to say good-bye. The voice of GAEV is heard: "Thank<br>
        you, brothers, thank you."]</p>
<a name=1.4.515><b>YASHA.</b> The common people have come to say good-bye. I am of the opinion,<br>
        Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that they're good people, but they don't<br>
        understand very much.</a><br>
<p>[The voices die away. LUBOV ANDREYEVNA and GAEV enter. She is not crying<br>
        but is pale, and her face trembles; she can hardly speak.]</p>
<a name=1.4.516><b>GAEV.</b> You gave them your purse, Luba. You can't go on like that, you<br>
        can't!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.517><b>LUBOV.</b> I couldn't help myself, I couldn't! [They go out.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.518><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [In the doorway, calling after them] Please, I ask you most<br>
        humbly! Just a little glass to say good-bye. I didn't remember to bring<br>
        any from town and I only found one bottle at the station. Please, do!<br>
        [Pause] Won't you really have any? [Goes away from the door] If I only<br>
        knew&mdash;I wouldn't have bought any. Well, I shan't drink any either.<br>
        [YASHA carefully puts the tray on a chair] You have a drink, Yasha, at<br>
        any rate.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.519><b>YASHA.</b> To those departing! And good luck to those who stay behind!<br>
        [Drinks] I can assure you that this isn't real champagne.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.520><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Eight roubles a bottle. [Pause] It's devilish cold here.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.521><b>YASHA.</b> There are no fires to-day, we're going away. [Laughs]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.522><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> What's the matter with you?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.523><b>YASHA.</b> I'm just pleased.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.524><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> It's October outside, but it's as sunny and as quiet as if it<br>
        were summer. Good for building. [Looking at his watch and speaking<br>
        through the door] Ladies and gentlemen, please remember that it's only<br>
        forty-seven minutes till the train goes! You must go off to the station<br>
        in twenty minutes. Hurry up.</a><br>
<p>[TROFIMOV, in an overcoat, comes in from the grounds.]</p>
<a name=1.4.525><b>TROFIMOV.</b> I think it's time we went. The carriages are waiting. Where<br>
        the devil are my goloshes? They're lost. [Through the door] Anya, I<br>
        can't find my goloshes! I can't!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.526><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> I've got to go to Kharkov. I'm going in the same train as you.<br>
        I'm going to spend the whole winter in Kharkov. I've been hanging about<br>
        with you people, going rusty without work. I can't live without working.<br>
        I must have something to do with my hands; they hang about as if they<br>
        weren't mine at all.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.527><b>TROFIMOV.</b> We'll go away now and then you'll start again on your useful<br>
        labours.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.528><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Have a glass.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.529><b>TROFIMOV.</b> I won't.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.530><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> So you're off to Moscow now?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.531><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Yes. I'll see them into town and to-morrow I'm off to Moscow.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.532><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Yes.... I expect the professors don't lecture nowadays;<br>
        they're waiting till you turn up!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.533><b>TROFIMOV.</b> That's not your business.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.534><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> How many years have you been going to the university?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.535><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Think of something fresh. This is old and flat. [Looking for<br>
        his goloshes] You know, we may not meet each other again, so just let me<br>
        give you a word of advice on parting: "Don't wave your hands about! Get<br>
        rid of that habit of waving them about. And then, building villas and<br>
        reckoning on their residents becoming freeholders in time&mdash;that's<br>
        the same thing; it's all a matter of waving your hands about.... Whether<br>
        I want to or not, you know, I like you. You've thin, delicate fingers,<br>
        like those of an artist, and you've a thin, delicate soul...."</a><br>
<a name=1.4.536><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Embraces him] Good-bye, dear fellow. Thanks for all you've<br>
        said. If you want any, take some money from me for the journey.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.537><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Why should I? I don't want it.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.538><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> But you've nothing!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.539><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Yes, I have, thank you; I've got some for a translation. Here<br>
        it is in my pocket. [Nervously] But I can't find my goloshes!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.540><b>VARYA.</b> [From the other room] Take your rubbish away! [Throws a pair of<br>
        rubber goloshes on to the stage.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.541><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Why are you angry, Varya? Hm! These aren't my goloshes!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.542><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> In the spring I sowed three thousand acres of poppies, and now<br>
        I've made forty thousand roubles net profit. And when my poppies were in<br>
        flower, what a picture it was! So I, as I was saying, made forty<br>
        thousand roubles, and I mean I'd like to lend you some, because I can<br>
        afford it. Why turn up your nose at it? I'm just a simple peasant....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.543><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Your father was a peasant, mine was a chemist, and that means<br>
        absolutely nothing. [LOPAKHIN takes out his pocket-book] No, no.... Even<br>
        if you gave me twenty thousand I should refuse. I'm a free man. And<br>
        everything that all you people, rich and poor, value so highly and so<br>
        dearly hasn't the least influence over me; it's like a flock of down in<br>
        the wind. I can do without you, I can pass you by. I'm strong and proud.<br>
        Mankind goes on to the highest truths and to the highest happiness such<br>
        as is only possible on earth, and I go in the front ranks!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.544><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Will you get there?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.545><b>TROFIMOV.</b> I will. [Pause] I'll get there and show others the way. [Axes<br>
        cutting the trees are heard in the distance.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.546><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Well, good-bye, old man. It's time to go. Here we stand<br>
        pulling one another's noses, but life goes its own way all the time.<br>
        When I work for a long time, and I don't get tired, then I think more<br>
        easily, and I think I get to understand why I exist. And there are so<br>
        many people in Russia, brother, who live for nothing at all. Still, work<br>
        goes on without that. Leonid Andreyevitch, they say, has accepted a post<br>
        in a bank; he will get sixty thousand roubles a year.... But he won't<br>
        stand it; he's very lazy.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.547><b>ANYA.</b> [At the door] Mother asks if you will stop them cutting down the<br>
        orchard until she has gone away.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.548><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Yes, really, you ought to have enough tact not to do that.<br>
        [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.549><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> All right, all right... yes, he's right. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.550><b>ANYA.</b> Has Fiers been sent to the hospital?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.551><b>YASHA.</b> I gave the order this morning. I suppose they've sent him.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.552><b>ANYA.</b> [To EPIKHODOV, who crosses the room] Simeon Panteleyevitch, please<br>
        make inquiries if Fiers has been sent to the hospital.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.553><b>YASHA.</b> [Offended] I told Egor this morning. What's the use of asking ten<br>
        times!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.554><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> The aged Fiers, in my conclusive opinion, isn't worth<br>
        mending; his forefathers had better have him. I only envy him. [Puts a<br>
        trunk on a hat-box and squashes it] Well, of course. I thought so!<br>
        [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.555><b>YASHA.</b> [Grinning] Two-and-twenty troubles.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.556><b>VARYA.</b> [Behind the door] Has Fiers been taken away to the hospital?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.557><b>ANYA.</b> Yes.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.558><b>VARYA.</b> Why didn't they take the letter to the doctor?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.559><b>ANYA.</b> It'll have to be sent after him. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.560><b>VARYA.</b> [In the next room] Where's Yasha? Tell him his mother's come and<br>
        wants to say good-bye to him.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.561><b>YASHA.</b> [Waving his hand] She'll make me lose all patience!</a><br>
<p>[DUNYASHA has meanwhile been bustling round the luggage; now that YASHA<br>
        is left alone, she goes up to him.]</p>
<a name=1.4.562><b>DUNYASHA.</b> If you only looked at me once, Yasha. You're going away,<br>
        leaving me behind.</a><br>
<p>[Weeps and hugs him round the neck.]</p>
<a name=1.4.563><b>YASHA.</b> What's the use of crying? [Drinks champagne] In six days I'll be<br>
        again in Paris. To-morrow we get into the express and off we go. I can<br>
        hardly believe it. Vive la France! It doesn't suit me here, I can't live<br>
        here... it's no good. Well, I've seen the uncivilized world; I have had<br>
        enough of it. [Drinks champagne] What do you want to cry for? You behave<br>
        yourself properly, and then you won't cry.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.564><b>DUNYASHA.</b> [Looks in a small mirror and powders her face] Send me a<br>
        letter from Paris. You know I loved you, Yasha, so much! I'm a sensitive<br>
        creature, Yasha.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.565><b>YASHA.</b> Somebody's coming.</a><br>
<p>[He bustles around the luggage, singing softly. Enter LUBOV ANDREYEVNA,<br>
        GAEV, ANYA, and CHARLOTTA IVANOVNA.]</p>
<a name=1.4.566><b>GAEV.</b> We'd better be off. There's no time left. [Looks at YASHA]<br>
        Somebody smells of herring!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.567><b>LUBOV.</b> We needn't get into our carriages for ten minutes.... [Looks<br>
        round the room] Good-bye, dear house, old grandfather. The winter will<br>
        go, the spring will come, and then you'll exist no more, you'll be<br>
        pulled down. How much these walls have seen! [Passionately kisses her<br>
        daughter] My treasure, you're radiant, your eyes flash like two jewels!<br>
        Are you happy? Very?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.568><b>ANYA.</b> Very! A new life is beginning, mother!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.569><b>GAEV.</b> [Gaily] Yes, really, everything's all right now. Before the cherry<br>
        orchard was sold we all were excited and we suffered, and then, when the<br>
        question was solved once and for all, we all calmed down, and even<br>
        became cheerful. I'm a bank official now, and a financier... red in the<br>
        middle; and you, Luba, for some reason or other, look better, there's no<br>
        doubt about it.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.570><b>LUBOV.</b> Yes. My nerves are better, it's true. [She puts on her coat and<br>
        hat] I sleep well. Take my luggage out, Yasha. It's time. [To ANYA] My<br>
        little girl, we'll soon see each other again.... I'm off to Paris. I'll<br>
        live there on the money your grandmother from Yaroslav sent along to buy<br>
        the estate&mdash;bless her!&mdash;though it won't last long.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.571><b>ANYA.</b> You'll come back soon, soon, mother, won't you? I'll get ready,<br>
        and pass the exam at the Higher School, and then I'll work and help you.<br>
        We'll read all sorts of books to one another, won't we? [Kisses her<br>
        mother's hands] We'll read in the autumn evenings; we'll read many<br>
        books, and a beautiful new world will open up before us....<br>
        [Thoughtfully] You'll come, mother....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.572><b>LUBOV.</b> I'll come, my darling. [Embraces her.]</a><br>
<p>[Enter LOPAKHIN. CHARLOTTA is singing to herself.]</p>
<a name=1.4.573><b>GAEV.</b> Charlotta is happy; she sings!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.574><b>CHARLOTTA.</b> [Takes a bundle, looking like a wrapped-up baby] My little<br>
        baby, bye-bye. [The baby seems to answer, "Oua! Oua!"] Hush, my nice<br>
        little boy. ["Oua! Oua!"] I'm so sorry for you! [Throws the bundle back]<br>
        So please find me a new place. I can't go on like this.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.575><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> We'll find one, Charlotta Ivanovna, don't you be afraid.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.576><b>GAEV.</b> Everybody's leaving us. Varya's going away... we've suddenly<br>
        become unnecessary.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.577><b>CHARLOTTA.</b> I've nowhere to live in town. I must go away. [Hums] Never<br>
        mind.</a><br>
<p>[Enter PISCHIN.]</p>
<a name=1.4.578><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Nature's marvel!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.579><b>PISCHIN.</b> [Puffing] Oh, let me get my breath back.... I'm fagged out...<br>
        My most honoured, give me some water....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.580><b>GAEV.</b> Come for money, what? I'm your humble servant, and I'm going out<br>
        of the way of temptation. [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.581><b>PISCHIN.</b> I haven't been here for ever so long... dear madam. [To<br>
        LOPAKHIN] You here? Glad to see you... man of immense brain... take<br>
        this... take it.... [Gives LOPAKHIN money] Four hundred roubles.... That<br>
        leaves 840....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.582><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Shrugs his shoulders in surprise] As if I were dreaming.<br>
        Where did you get this from?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.583><b>PISCHIN.</b> Stop... it's hot.... A most unexpected thing happened. Some<br>
        Englishmen came along and found some white clay on my land.... [To LUBOV<br>
        ANDREYEVNA] And here's four hundred for you... beautiful lady.... [Gives<br>
        her money] Give you the rest later.... [Drinks water] Just now a young<br>
        man in the train was saying that some great philosopher advises us all<br>
        to jump off roofs. "Jump!" he says, and that's all. [Astonished] To<br>
        think of that, now! More water!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.584><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Who were these Englishmen?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.585><b>PISCHIN.</b> I've leased off the land with the clay to them for twenty-four<br>
        years.... Now, excuse me, I've no time.... I must run off.... I must go<br>
        to Znoikov and to Kardamonov... I owe them all money.... [Drinks]<br>
        Good-bye. I'll come in on Thursday.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.586><b>LUBOV.</b> We're just off to town, and to-morrow I go abroad.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.587><b>PISCHIN.</b> [Agitated] What? Why to town? I see furniture... trunks....<br>
        Well, never mind. [Crying] Never mind. These Englishmen are men of<br>
        immense intellect.... Never mind.... Be happy.... God will help you....<br>
        Never mind.... Everything in this world comes to an end.... [Kisses<br>
        LUBOV ANDREYEVNA'S hand] And if you should happen to hear that my end<br>
        has come, just remember this old... horse and say: "There was one such<br>
        and such a Simeonov-Pischin, God bless his soul...." Wonderful<br>
        weather... yes.... [Exit deeply moved, but returns at once and says in<br>
        the door] Dashenka sent her love! [Exit.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.588><b>LUBOV.</b> Now we can go. I've two anxieties, though. The first is poor<br>
        Fiers [Looks at her watch] We've still five minutes....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.589><b>ANYA.</b> Mother, Fiers has already been sent to the hospital. Yasha sent<br>
        him off this morning.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.590><b>LUBOV.</b> The second is Varya. She's used to getting up early and to work,<br>
        and now she's no work to do she's like a fish out of water. She's grown<br>
        thin and pale, and she cries, poor thing.... [Pause] You know very well,<br>
        Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that I used to hope to marry her to you, and I<br>
        suppose you are going to marry somebody? [Whispers to ANYA, who nods to<br>
        CHARLOTTA, and they both go out] She loves you, she's your sort, and I<br>
        don't understand, I really don't, why you seem to be keeping away from<br>
        each other. I don't understand!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.591><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> To tell the truth, I don't understand it myself. It's all so<br>
        strange.... If there's still time, I'll be ready at once... Let's get it<br>
        over, once and for all; I don't feel as if I could ever propose to her<br>
        without you.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.592><b>LUBOV.</b> Excellent. It'll only take a minute. I'll call her.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.593><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> The champagne's very appropriate. [Looking at the tumblers]<br>
        They're empty, somebody's already drunk them. [YASHA coughs] I call that<br>
        licking it up....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.594><b>LUBOV.</b> [Animated] Excellent. We'll go out. Yasha, allez. I'll call her<br>
        in.... [At the door] Varya, leave that and come here. Come! [Exit with<br>
        YASHA.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.595><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [Looks at his watch] Yes.... [Pause.]</a><br>
<p>[There is a restrained laugh behind the door, a whisper, then VARYA<br>
        comes in.]</p>
<a name=1.4.596><b>VARYA.</b> [Looking at the luggage in silence] I can't seem to find it....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.597><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> What are you looking for?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.598><b>VARYA.</b> I packed it myself and I don't remember. [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.599><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Where are you going to now, Barbara Mihailovna?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.600><b>VARYA.</b> I? To the Ragulins.... I've got an agreement to go and look after<br>
        their house... as housekeeper or something.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.601><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Is that at Yashnevo? It's about fifty miles. [Pause] So life<br>
        in this house is finished now....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.602><b>VARYA.</b> [Looking at the luggage] Where is it?... perhaps I've put it away<br>
        in the trunk.... Yes, there'll be no more life in this house....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.603><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> And I'm off to Kharkov at once... by this train. I've a lot of<br>
        business on hand. I'm leaving Epikhodov here... I've taken him on.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.604><b>VARYA.</b> Well, well!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.605><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Last year at this time the snow was already falling, if you<br>
        remember, and now it's nice and sunny. Only it's rather cold.... There's<br>
        three degrees of frost.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.606><b>VARYA.</b> I didn't look. [Pause] And our thermometer's broken.... [Pause.]</a><br>
<a name=1.4.607><b>VOICE AT THE DOOR.</b> Ermolai Alexeyevitch!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.608><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> [As if he has long been waiting to be called] This minute.<br>
        [Exit quickly.]</a><br>
<p>[VARYA, sitting on the floor, puts her face on a bundle of clothes and<br>
        weeps gently. The door opens. LUBOV ANDREYEVNA enters carefully.]</p>
<a name=1.4.609><b>LUBOV.</b> Well? [Pause] We must go.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.610><b>VARYA.</b> [Not crying now, wipes her eyes] Yes, it's quite time, little<br>
        mother. I'll get to the Ragulins to-day, if I don't miss the train....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.611><b>LUBOV.</b> [At the door] Anya, put on your things. [Enter ANYA, then GAEV,<br>
        CHARLOTTA IVANOVNA. GAEV wears a warm overcoat with a cape. A servant<br>
        and drivers come in. EPIKHODOV bustles around the luggage] Now we can go<br>
        away.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.612><b>ANYA.</b> [Joyfully] Away!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.613><b>GAEV.</b> My friends, my dear friends! Can I be silent, in leaving this<br>
        house for evermore?&mdash;can I restrain myself, in saying farewell,<br>
        from expressing those feelings which now fill my whole being...?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.614><b>ANYA.</b> [Imploringly] Uncle!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.615><b>VARYA.</b> Uncle, you shouldn't!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.616><b>GAEV.</b> [Stupidly] Double the red into the middle.... I'll be quiet.</a><br>
<p>[Enter TROFIMOV, then LOPAKHIN.]</p>
<a name=1.4.617><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Well, it's time to be off.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.618><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Epikhodov, my coat!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.619><b>LUBOV.</b> I'll sit here one more minute. It's as if I'd never really<br>
        noticed what the walls and ceilings of this house were like, and now I<br>
        look at them greedily, with such tender love....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.620><b>GAEV.</b> I remember, when I was six years old, on Trinity Sunday, I sat at<br>
        this window and looked and saw my father going to church....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.621><b>LUBOV.</b> Have all the things been taken away?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.622><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Yes, all, I think. [To EPIKHODOV, putting on his coat] You see<br>
        that everything's quite straight, Epikhodov.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.623><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> [Hoarsely] You may depend upon me, Ermolai Alexeyevitch!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.624><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> What's the matter with your voice?</a><br>
<a name=1.4.625><b>EPIKHODOV.</b> I swallowed something just now; I was having a drink of<br>
        water.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.626><b>YASHA.</b> [Suspiciously] What manners....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.627><b>LUBOV.</b> We go away, and not a soul remains behind.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.628><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Till the spring.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.629><b>VARYA.</b> [Drags an umbrella out of a bundle, and seems to be waving it<br>
        about. LOPAKHIN appears to be frightened] What are you doing?... I never<br>
        thought...</a><br>
<a name=1.4.630><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Come along, let's take our seats... it's time! The train will<br>
        be in directly.</a><br>
<a name=1.4.631><b>VARYA.</b> Peter, here they are, your goloshes, by that trunk. [In tears]<br>
        And how old and dirty they are....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.632><b>TROFIMOV.</b> [Putting them on] Come on!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.633><b>GAEV.</b> [Deeply moved, nearly crying] The train... the station.... Cross<br>
        in the middle, a white double in the corner....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.634><b>LUBOV.</b> Let's go!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.635><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Are you all here? There's nobody else? [Locks the side-door on<br>
        the left] There's a lot of things in there. I must lock them up. Come!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.636><b>ANYA.</b> Good-bye, home! Good-bye, old life!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.637><b>TROFIMOV.</b> Welcome, new life! [Exit with ANYA.]</a><br>
<p>[VARYA looks round the room and goes out slowly. YASHA and CHARLOTTA,<br>
        with her little dog, go out.]</p>
<a name=1.4.638><b>LOPAKHIN.</b> Till the spring, then! Come on... till we meet again! [Exit.]</a><br>
<p>[LUBOV ANDREYEVNA and GAEV are left alone. They might almost have been<br>
        waiting for that. They fall into each other's arms and sob restrainedly<br>
        and quietly, fearing that somebody might hear them.]</p>
<a name=1.4.639><b>GAEV.</b> [In despair] My sister, my sister....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.640><b>LUBOV.</b> My dear, my gentle, beautiful orchard! My life, my youth, my<br>
        happiness, good-bye! Good-bye!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.641><b>ANYA'S VOICE.</b> [Gaily] Mother!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.642><b>TROFIMOV'S VOICE.</b> [Gaily, excited] Coo-ee!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.643><b>LUBOV.</b> To look at the walls and the windows for the last time.... My<br>
        dead mother used to like to walk about this room....</a><br>
<a name=1.4.644><b>GAEV.</b> My sister, my sister!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.645><b>ANYA'S VOICE.</b> Mother!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.646><b>TROFIMOV'S VOICE.</b> Coo-ee!</a><br>
<a name=1.4.647><b>LUBOV.</b> We're coming! [They go out.]</a><br>
<p>[The stage is empty. The sound of keys being turned in the locks is<br>
        heard, and then the noise of the carriages going away. It is quiet. Then<br>
        the sound of an axe against the trees is heard in the silence sadly and<br>
        by itself. Steps are heard. FIERS comes in from the door on the right.<br>
        He is dressed as usual, in a short jacket and white waistcoat; slippers<br>
        on his feet. He is ill. He goes to the door and tries the handle.]</p>
<a name=1.4.648><b>FIERS.</b> It's locked. They've gone away. [Sits on a sofa] They've<br>
        forgotten about me.... Never mind, I'll sit here.... And Leonid<br>
        Andreyevitch will have gone in a light overcoat instead of putting on<br>
        his fur coat.... [Sighs anxiously] I didn't see.... Oh, these young<br>
        people! [Mumbles something that cannot be understood] Life's gone on as<br>
        if I'd never lived. [Lying down] I'll lie down.... You've no strength<br>
        left in you, nothing left at all.... Oh, you... bungler!</a><br>
<p>[He lies without moving. The distant sound is heard, as if from the sky,<br>
        of a breaking string, dying away sadly. Silence follows it, and only the<br>
        sound is heard, some way away in the orchard, of the axe falling on the<br>
        trees.]</p>
