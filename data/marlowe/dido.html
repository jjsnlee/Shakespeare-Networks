<p id="id00030" style="margin-top: 3em">[Transcriber's Note: The following paragraphs have been
transcribed from a handwritten page. Some text is illegible, and
this has been marked with asterisks where appropriate.]</p>

<p id="id00031">The tragedy of <i>Dido</i> is one of the scarcest plays in the English
language. There are but two copies known to be extant; in the
possession of D^r Wright and M^r Reed.</p>

<p id="id00032">M^r Warton speaks in his <i>Hist. of Eng. Poet</i> (III. p. 435) of an
Elegy being prefixed to it on the death of Marlowe; but no such
is found in either of those copies. In answer to my inquiries on
this subject he informed me by letter, [crossed-out text] that a
copy of this play was in Osborne's catalogue in the year 1754,
that he then saw it in his shop (together with several of M^r
Oldys's books that Osborne had purchased), + that the elegy in
question—"on Marlowe's untimely death" was inserted immediately
after the title page; that it mentioned a play of Marlowe's
entitled <i>The Duke of Guise</i> and four others; but whether
particularly by <i>name</i>, he could not recollect. Unluckily he did
not purchase this rare piece, + it is now God knows where.</p>

<p id="id00033">Bishop Tanner likewise mentions this elegy in so particular a
manner that he must have seen it. "Marlovius (Christopherus),
quondam in academia Cantabrigiensi musarum alumnus; postea actor
scenicus; deinde poeta dramaticus tragicus, paucis inferior
Scripsit plurimas tragedias, sc. Tamerlane.-Tragedie of Dido
Queen of Carthage. Pr. Come gentle Ganymed. Hanc perfecit +
edidit Tho. Nash Lond. 1594. 4^to.—Petrarius in præfatione ad
Secundam partem Herois et Leandri multa in Marlovii
commendationem adfert; hoc etiam facit Tho. Nash in <i>Carmine
Elegiaco Tragidiæ Didonis præfiso in obitum Christop. Marlovii</i>,
ubi quatuor ejus tragidiarum mentionem facit, nec non et alterius
<i>de duce Guisio</i>." <i>Bib. Britan.</i> 1740.</p>

<p id="id00034">I suspect M^r Warton had no other authority than this for saying
that this play was left imperfect by Marlowe, and completed +
published by Nashe; for it does not appear from the title page
that it was not written in conjunction by him + Marlowe in the
lifetime of the former. Perhaps Nashe's Elegy might ascertain
this point. Tanner had, I believe, no authority but Philipses,
for calling Marlowe an actor.</p>

<p id="id00035">There was an old Latin play on the subject of Dido, written by<br/>

John Rightwise and played before Cardinal Wolsey + again before<br/>

Queen Elizabeth in 1564. There is also another Latin play on this<br/>

subject <i>Dido</i>, tragedia nova  so quatuor pri*ibus ***<br/>

To day when as I fild into your cups,<br/>

And held the cloath of pleasance whiles you dranke,<br/>

To hang her meteor like twixt heauen and earth,<br/>

O how would I with <i>Helens</i> brother laugh,<br/>

Sweet <i>Iupiter</i>, if ere I pleasde thine eye,<br/>

Or seemed faire walde in with Egles wings,<br/>

Grace my immortall beautie with this boone,<br/>

And I will spend my time in thy bright armes.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00051"><i>Iup.</i> What ist sweet wagge I should deny thy youth?<br/>

Whose face reflects such pleasure to mine eyes,<br/>

As I exhal'd with thy fire darting beames,<br/>

Haue oft driuen backe the horses of the night.<br/>

When as they would haue hal'd thee from my sight:<br/>

Sit on my knee, and call for thy content,<br/>

Controule proud Fate, and cut the thred of time,<br/>

Why are not all the Gods at thy commaund,<br/>

And heauen and earth the bounds of thy delight?<br/>

<i>Vulcan</i> shall daunce to make thee laughing sport,<br/>

And my nine Daughters sing when thou art sad,<br/>

From <i>Iunos</i> bird Ile pluck her spotted pride,<br/>

To make thee fannes wherewith to coole thy face,<br/>

And <i>Venus</i> Swannes shall shed their siluer downe,<br/>

To sweeten out the slumbers of thy bed:<br/>

<i>Hermes</i> no more shall shew the world his wings,<br/>

If that thy fancie in his feathers dwell,<br/>

But as this one Ile teare them all from him,<br/>

Doe thou but say their colour pleaseth me:<br/>

Hold here my little loue these linked gems,<br/>

My <i>Iuno</i> ware vpon her marriage day,<br/>

Put thou about thy necke my owne sweet heart,<br/>

And tricke thy armes and shoulders with my theft.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00052"><i>Gan.</i> I would haue a iewell for mine eare,

<p id="id00055"><i>Venus.</i> I this is it, you can sit toying there,<br/>

And playing with that female wanton boy,<br/>

Whiles my <i>Æneas</i> wanders on the Seas,<br/>

And rests a pray to euery billowes pride.<br/>

<i>Iuno</i>, false <i>Iuno</i> in her Chariots pompe,<br/>

Drawne through the heauens by Steedes of <i>Boreas</i> brood,<br/>

Made <i>Hebe</i> to direct her ayrie wheeles<br/>

Into the windie countrie of the clowdes,<br/>

Where finding <i>Æolus</i> intrencht with stormes,<br/>

And guarded with a thousand grislie ghosts,<br/>

She humbly did beseech him for our bane,<br/>

And charg'd him drowne my sonne with all his traine.<br/>

Then gan the windes breake ope their brazen doores,<br/>

And all <i>Æolia</i> to be vp in armes:<br/>

Poore <i>Troy</i> must now be sackt vpon the Sea,<br/>

And <i>Neptunes</i> waues be enuious men of warre,<br/>

<i>Epeus</i> horse to <i>Ætnas</i> hill transformd,<br/>

Prepared stands to wracke their woodden walles,<br/>

And <i>Æolus</i> like <i>Agamemnon</i> sounds<br/>

The surges, his fierce souldiers to the spoyle:<br/>

See how the night <i>Ulysses</i>-like comes forth,<br/>

And intercepts the day as <i>Dolon</i> erst:<br/>

Ay me! the Starres supprisde like <i>Rhesus</i> Steedes,<br/>

Are drawne by darknes forth <i>Astræus</i> tents.<br/>

What shall I doe to saue thee my sweet boy?<br/>

When as the waues doe threat our Chrystall world,<br/>

And <i>Proteus</i> raising hils of flouds on high,<br/>

Entends ere long to sport him in the skie.<br/>

False <i>Iupiter</i>, rewardst thou vertue so?<br/>

What? is not pietie exempt from woe?<br/>

Then dye <i>Æneas</i> in thine innocence,<br/>

Since that religion hath no recompence.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00056"><i>Iup.</i> Content thee <i>Cytherea</i> in thy care,<br/>

Since thy <i>Æneas</i> wandring fate is firme,<br/>

Whose wearie lims shall shortly make repose,<br/>

In those faire walles I promist him of yore:<br/>

But first in bloud must his good fortune bud,<br/>

Before he be the Lord of <i>Turnus</i> towne,<br/>

Or force her smile that hetherto hath frownd:<br/>

Three winters shall he with the Rutiles warre,<br/>

And in the end subdue them with his sword,<br/>

And full three Sommers likewise shall he waste,<br/>

In mannaging those fierce barbarian mindes:<br/>

Which once performd, poore <i>Troy</i> so long supprest,<br/>

From forth her ashes shall aduance her head,<br/>

And flourish once againe that erst was dead:<br/>

But bright <i>Ascanius</i> beauties better worke,<br/>

Who with the Sunne deuides one radiant shape,<br/>

Shall build his throne amidst those starrie towers,<br/>

That earth-borne <i>Atlas</i> groning vnderprops:<br/>

No bounds but heauen shall bound his Emperie,<br/>

Whose azured gates enchased with his name,<br/>

Shall make the morning halt her gray vprise,<br/>

To feede her eyes with his engrauen fame.<br/>

Thus in stoute <i>Hectors</i> race three hundred yeares,<br/>

The Romane Scepter royall shall remaine,<br/>

Till that a Princesse priest conceau'd by <i>Mars</i>,<br/>

Shall yeeld to dignitie a dubble birth,<br/>

Who will eternish <i>Troy</i> in their attempts.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00057"><i>Venus.</i> How may I credite these thy flattering termes,<br/>

When yet both sea and sands beset their ships,<br/>

And <i>Phœbus</i> as in stygian pooles, refraines<br/>

To taint his tresses in the Tyrrhen maine?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00058"><i>Iup.</i> I will take order for that presently:
<i>Hermes</i> awake, and haste to <i>Neptunes</i> realme,
Whereas the Wind-god warring now with Fate,
Besiege the ofspring of our kingly loynes,
Charge him from me to turne his stormie powers,
And fetter them in <i>Vulcans</i> sturdie brasse,
That durst thus proudly wrong our kinsmans peace.
<i>Venus</i> farewell, thy sonne shall be our care:
Come <i>Ganimed</i>, we must about this geare.</p>

<p id="id00059"><i>Exeunt Iupiter cum Ganimed.</i></p>

<p id="id00060"><i>Venus.</i> Disquiet Seas lay downe your swelling lookes,<br/>

And court <i>Æneas</i> with your calmie cheere,<br/>

Whose beautious burden well might make you proude,<br/>

Had not the heauens conceau'd with hel-borne clowdes,<br/>

Vaild his resplendant glorie from your view,<br/>

For my sake pitie him <i>Oceanus</i>,<br/>

That erst-while issued from thy watrie loynes,<br/>

And had my being from thy bubling froth:<br/>

<i>Triton</i> I know hath fild his trumpe with <i>Troy</i>,<br/>

And therefore will take pitie on his toyle,<br/>

And call both <i>Thetis</i> and <i>Cimodoæ</i>,<br/>

Great <i>Iupiter</i>, still honourd maist thou be,<br/>

For this so friendly ayde in time of neede.<br/>

Here in this bush disguised will I stand,<br/>

Both barking <i>Scilla</i>, and the sounding Rocks,<br/>

The <i>Cyclops</i> shelues, and grim <i>Ceranias</i> seate<br/>

Haue you oregone, and yet remaine aliue!<br/>

Pluck vp your hearts, since fate still rests our friend,<br/>

Whose night and day descendeth from thy browes:<br/>

Though we be now in extreame miserie,<br/>

And rest the map of weatherbeaten woe:<br/>

Yet shall the aged Sunne shed forth his aire,<br/>

<p id="id00089"><i>Acha.</i> Why stands my sweete <i>Æneas</i> thus amazde?</p>

<p id="id00090"><i>Æn.</i> O my <i>Achates</i>, Theban <i>Niobe</i>,<br/>

Who for her sonnes death wept out life and breath,<br/>

And drie with griefe was turnd into a stone,<br/>

Had not such passions in her head as I.<br/>

Me thinkes that towne there should be <i>Troy</i>, yon <i>Idas</i> hill,<br/>

And would my prayers (as <i>Pigmalions</i> did)<br/>

Could giue it life, that vnder his conduct<br/>

We might saile backe to <i>Troy</i> and be reuengde<br/>

On these hard harted Grecians; which reioyce<br/>

That nothing now is left of <i>Priamus</i>:<br/>

O <i>Priamus</i> is left and this is he,<br/>

Come, come abourd, pursue the hatefull Greekes.<br/>

<p id="id00093"><i>Acha.</i> What means <i>Æneas</i>?</p>

<p id="id00094"><i>Æn.</i> <i>Achates</i> though mine eyes say this is stone,

And when my grieued heart sighes and sayes no,
Then would it leape out to giue <i>Priam</i> life:
O were I not at all so thou mightst be.
<i>Achates</i>, see King <i>Priam</i> wags his hand,
He is aliue, <i>Troy</i> is not ouercome.</p>

<p id="id00095"><i>Ach.</i> Thy mind <i>Æneas</i> that would haue it so

Who for <i>Troyes</i> sake hath entertaind vs all,<br/>

And clad vs in these wealthie robes we weare.<br/>

Oft hath she askt vs vnder whom we seru'd,<br/>

And when we told her she would weepe for griefe,<br/>

Thinking the sea had swallowed vp thy ships,<br/>

And now she sees thee how will she reioyce?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00114"><i>Serg.</i> See where her seruitors passe through the hall
Bearing a banket, <i>Dido</i> is not farre.</p>

<p id="id00115"><i>Illio.</i> Looke where she comes: <i>Æneas</i> viewd her well.</p>

<p id="id00116"><i>Æn.</i> Well may I view her, but she sees not me.</p>

<p id="id00117"><i>Enter Dido and her traine.</i></p>

<p id="id00118"><i>Dido.</i> What stranger art thou that doest eye me thus?</p>

<p id="id00119"><i>Æn.</i> Sometime I was a Troian mightie Queene:
But <i>Troy</i> is not, what shall I say I am?</p>

<p id="id00120"><i>Illio.</i> Renowmed <i>Dido</i>, tis our Generall: warlike <i>Æneas</i>.</p>

<p id="id00121"><i>Dido.</i> Warlike <i>Æneas</i>, and in these base robes?
Goe fetch the garment which <i>Sicheus</i> ware:
Braue Prince, welcome to Carthage and to me,
Both happie that <i>Æneas</i> is our guest:
Sit in this chaire and banquet with a Queene,
<i>Æneas</i> is <i>Æneas</i>, were he clad
In weedes as bad as euer <i>Irus</i> ware.</p>

<p id="id00122"><i>Æn.</i> This is no seate for one thats comfortles,<br/>

May it please your grace to let <i>Æneas</i> waite:<br/>

For though my birth be great, my fortunes meane,<br/>

Too meane to be companion to a Queene.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00123"><i>Dido.</i> Thy fortune may be greater then thy birth,<br/>

Sit downe <i>Æneas</i>, sit in <i>Didos</i> place,<br/>

And if this be thy sonne as I suppose,<br/>

Here let him sit, be merrie louely child.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00124"><i>Æn.</i> This place beseemes me not, O pardon me.</p>

<p id="id00132"><i>Æn.</i> O <i>Priamus</i>, O <i>Troy</i>, oh <i>Hecuba</i>!</p>

<p id="id00133"><i>Dido.</i> May I entreate thee to discourse at large,<br/>

And truely to how <i>Troy</i> was ouercome:<br/>

For many tales goe of that Cities fall,<br/>

And scarcely doe agree vpon one poynt:<br/>

Some say <i>Antenor</i> did betray the towne,<br/>

Others report twas <i>Sinons</i> periurie:<br/>

But all in this that <i>Troy</i> is ouercome,<br/>

And <i>Priam</i> dead, yet how we heare no newes.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00134"><i>Æn.</i> A wofull tale bids <i>Dido</i> to vnfould,<br/>

Whose memorie like pale deaths stony mace,<br/>

Beates forth my senses from this troubled soule,<br/>

And makes <i>Æneas</i> sinke at <i>Didos</i> feete.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00135"><i>Dido.</i> What faints <i>Æneas</i> to remember <i>Troy</i>?
In whose defence he fought so valiantly:
Looke vp and speake.</p>

<p id="id00136"><i>Æn.</i> Then speake <i>Æneas</i> with <i>Achilles</i> tongue,<br/>

And <i>Dido</i> and you Carthaginian Peeres<br/>

Heare me, but yet with <i>Mirmidons</i> harsh eares,<br/>

Daily inur'd to broyles and Massacres,<br/>

Lest you be mou'd too much with my sad tale.<br/>

The Grecian souldiers tired with ten yeares warre;<br/>

Began to crye, let vs vnto our ships,<br/>

<i>Troy</i> is inuincible, why stay we here?<br/>

With whose outcryes <i>Atrides</i> being apal'd,<br/>

Summoned the Captaines to his princely tent,<br/>

Who looking on the scarres we Troians gaue,<br/>

Seeing the number of their men decreast,<br/>

And the remainder weake and out of heart,<br/>

Gaue vp their voyces to dislodge the Campe,<br/>

And so in troopes all marcht to <i>Tenedos</i>:<br/>

Where when they came, <i>Vlysses</i> on the sand<br/>

Assayd with honey words to turne them backe:<br/>

And as he spoke to further his entent,<br/>

The windes did driue huge billowes to the shoare,<br/>

And heauen was darkned with tempestuous clowdes:<br/>

Then he alleag'd the Gods would haue them stay,<br/>

And prophecied <i>Troy</i> should be ouercome:<br/>

And therewithall he calde false <i>Sinon</i> forth,<br/>

A man compact of craft and periurie,<br/>

Whose ticing tongue was made of <i>Hermes</i> pipe,<br/>

To force an hundred watchfull eyes to sleepe:<br/>

And him <i>Epeus</i> hauing made the horse,<br/>

With sacrificing wreathes vpon his head,<br/>

<i>Vlysses</i> sent to our vnhappie towne:<br/>

Who groueling in the mire of <i>Zanthus</i> bankes,<br/>

His hands bound at his back, and both his eyes<br/>

Turnd vp to heauen as one resolu'd to dye,<br/>

Our Phrigian shepherd haled within the gates,<br/>

And brought vnto the Court of <i>Priamus</i>:<br/>

To whom he vsed action so pitifull,<br/>

Lookes so remorcefull, vowes so forcible,<br/>

As therewithall the old man ouercome,<br/>

Kist him, imbrast him, and vnloosde his bands,<br/>

And then, O <i>Dido</i> pardon me.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00137"><i>Dido.</i> Nay leaue not here, resolue me of the rest.</p>

<p id="id00138"><i>Æn.</i> O th'inchaunting words of that base slaue,<br/>

Made him to thinke <i>Epeus</i> pine-tree Horse<br/>

A sacrifize t'appease <i>Mineruas</i> wrath:<br/>

The rather for that one <i>Laocoon</i><br/>

Breaking a speare vpon his hollow breast,<br/>

Was with two winged Serpents stung to death.<br/>

Whereat agast, we were commanded straight<br/>

With reuerence to draw it into <i>Troy</i>.<br/>

In which vnhappie worke was I employd,<br/>

These hands did helpe to hale it to the gates,<br/>

Through which it could not enter twas so huge.<br/>

O had it neuer entred, <i>Troy</i> had stood.<br/>

But <i>Priamus</i> impatient of delay,<br/>

Inforst a wide breach in that rampierd wall,<br/>

Which thousand battering Rams could neuer pierce,<br/>

And so came in this fatall instrument:<br/>

At whose accursed feete as ouerioyed,<br/>

We banquetted till ouercome with wine,<br/>

Some surfetted, and others soundly slept.<br/>

Which <i>Sinon</i> viewing, causde the Greekish spyes<br/>

To hast to <i>Tenedos</i> and tell the Campe:<br/>

Then he vnlockt the Horse, and suddenly<br/>

From out his entrailes, <i>Neoptolemus</i><br/>

Setting his speare vpon the ground, leapt forth,<br/>

And after him a thousand Grecians more,<br/>

In whose sterne faces shin'd the quenchles fire,<br/>

That after burnt the pride of <i>Asia</i>.<br/>

By this the Campe was come vnto the walles,<br/>

And through the breach did march into the streetes,<br/>

Where meeting with the rest, kill kill they cryed.<br/>

Frighted with this confused noyse, I rose,<br/>

And looking from a turret, might behold<br/>

Yong infants swimming in their parents bloud,<br/>

Headles carkasses piled vp in heapes,<br/>

Virgins halfe dead dragged by their golden haire,<br/>

And with maine force flung on a ring of pikes,<br/>

Old men with swords thrust through their aged sides,<br/>

Kneeling for mercie to a Greekish lad,<br/>

Who with steele Pol-axes dasht out their braines.<br/>

Then buckled I mine armour, drew my sword,<br/>

And thinking to goe downe, came <i>Hectors</i> ghost<br/>

With ashie visage, blewish, sulphure eyes,<br/>

His armes torne from his shoulders, and his breast<br/>

Furrowd with wounds, and that which made me weepe,<br/>

Thongs at his heeles, by which <i>Achilles</i> horse<br/>

Drew him in triumph through the Greekish Campe,<br/>

Burst from the earth, crying, <i>Æneas</i> flye,<br/>

<i>Troy</i> is a fire, the Grecians haue the towne,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00139"><i>Dido.</i> O <i>Hector</i> who weepes not to heare thy name?</p>

<p id="id00140"><i>Æn.</i> Yet flung I forth, and desperate of my life,<br/>

Ran in the thickest throngs, and with this sword<br/>

Sent many of their sauadge ghosts to hell.<br/>

At last came <i>Pirrhus</i> fell and full of ire.<br/>

His harnesse dropping bloud, and on his speare<br/>

The mangled head of <i>Priams</i> yongest sonne,<br/>

And after him his band of Mirmidons,<br/>

With balles of wilde fire in their murdering pawes,<br/>

Which made the funerall flame that burnt faire <i>Troy</i>:<br/>

All which hemd me about, crying, this is he.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00141"><i>Dido.</i> Ah, how could poore <i>Æneas</i> scape their hands?</p>

<p id="id00142"><i>Æn.</i> My mother <i>Venus</i> iealous of my health,<br/>

Conuaid me from their crooked nets and bands:<br/>

So I escapt the furious <i>Pirrhus</i> wrath:<br/>

Who then ran to the pallace of the King,<br/>

And at <i>Ioues</i> Altar finding <i>Priamus</i>,<br/>

About whose withered necke hung <i>Hecuba</i>,<br/>

Foulding his hand in hers, and ioyntly both<br/>

Beating their breasts and falling on the ground,<br/>

He with his faulchions poynt raisde vp at once,<br/>

And with <i>Megeras</i> eyes stared in their face,<br/>

Threatning a thousand deaths at euery glaunce.<br/>

To whom the aged King thus trembling spoke:<br/>

<i>Achilles</i> sonne, remember what I was,<br/>

Father of fiftie sonnes, but they are slaine,<br/>

Lord of my fortune, but my fortunes turnd,<br/>

King of this Citie, but my <i>Troy</i> is fired,<br/>

And now am neither father, Lord, nor King:<br/>

Yet who so wretched but desires to liue?<br/>

O let me liue, great <i>Neoptolemus</i>,<br/>

Not mou'd at all, but smiling at his teares,<br/>

This butcher whil'st his hands were yet held vp,<br/>

Treading vpon his breast, strooke off his hands.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00143"><i>Dido.</i> O end <i>Æneas</i>, I can heare no more.</p>

<p id="id00144"><i>Æn.</i> At which the franticke Queene leapt on his face,<br/>

And in his eyelids hanging by the nayles,<br/>

A little while prolong'd her husbands life:<br/>

At last the souldiers puld her by the heeles,<br/>

And swong her howling in the emptie ayre,<br/>

Which sent an eccho to the wounded King:<br/>

Whereat he lifted vp his bedred lims,<br/>

And would haue grappeld with <i>Achilles</i> sonne,<br/>

Forgetting both his want of strength and hands,<br/>

Which he disdaining whiskt his sword about,<br/>

And with the wound thereof the King fell downe:<br/>

Then from the nauell to the throat at once,<br/>

He ript old <i>Priam</i>: at whose latter gaspe<br/>

<i>Ioues</i> marble statue gan to bend the brow,<br/>

As lothing <i>Pirrhus</i> for this wicked act:<br/>

Yet he vndaunted tooke his fathers flagge,<br/>

And dipt it in the old Kings chill cold bloud,<br/>

And then in triumph ran into the streetes,<br/>

Through which he could not passe for slaughtred men:<br/>

So leaning on his sword he stood stone still,<br/>

Viewing the fire wherewith rich <i>Ilion</i> burnt.<br/>

By this I got my father on my backe,<br/>

This yong boy in mine armes, and by the hand<br/>

Led faire <i>Creusa</i> my beloued wife,<br/>

When thou <i>Achates</i> with thy sword mad'st way,<br/>

And we were round inuiron'd with the Greekes:<br/>

O there I lost my wife: and had not we<br/>

Fought manfully, I had not told this tale:<br/>

Yet manhood would not serue, of force we fled,<br/>

And as we went vnto our ships, thou knowest<br/>

We sawe <i>Cassandra</i> sprauling in the streetes,<br/>

Whom <i>Aiax</i> rauisht in <i>Dianas</i> Fawne,<br/>

Her cheekes swolne with sighes, her haire all rent,<br/>

Whom I tooke vp to beare vnto our ships;<br/>

But suddenly the Grecians followed vs,<br/>

And I alas, was forst to let her lye.<br/>

Then got we to our ships, and being abourd,<br/>

<i>Polixena</i> cryed out, <i>Æneas</i> stay,<br/>

The Greekes pursue me, stay and take me in.<br/>

Moued with her voyce, I lept into the sea,<br/>

Thinking to beare her on my backe abourd:<br/>

For all our ships were launcht into the deepe,<br/>

And as I swomme, she standing on the shoare,<br/>

Was by the cruell Mirmidons surprizd,<br/>

And after by that <i>Pirrhus</i> sacrifizde.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00145"><i>Dido.</i> I dye with melting ruth, <i>Æneas</i> leaue.</p>

<p id="id00178"><i>Iar.</i> Come <i>Dido</i>, leaue <i>Ascanius</i>, let vs walke.</p>

<p id="id00179"><i>Dido.</i> Goe thou away, <i>Ascanius</i> shall stay.</p>

<p id="id00180"><i>Iar.</i> Vngentle Queene, is this thy loue to me?</p>

<p id="id00181"><i>Dido.</i> O stay <i>Iarbus</i>, and Ile goe with thee.</p>

<p id="id00182"><i>Cupid.</i> And if my mother goe, Ile follow her.</p>

<p id="id00183"><i>Dido.</i> Why staiest thou here? thou art no loue of mine?</p>

<p id="id00184"><i>Iar.</i> <i>Iarbus</i> dye, seeing she abandons thee.</p>

<p id="id00185"><i>Dido.</i> No, liue <i>Iarbus</i>, what hast thou deseru'd,<br/>

That I should say thou art no loue of mine?<br/>

Something thou hast deseru'd, away I say,<br/>

Depart from <i>Carthage</i>, come not in my sight.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00186"><i>Iar.</i> Am I not King of rich <i>Getulia</i>?</p>

<p id="id00187"><i>Dido.</i> <i>Iarbus</i> pardon me, and stay a while.</p>

<p id="id00188"><i>Cupid.</i> Mother, looke here.</p>

<p id="id00189"><i>Dido.</i> What telst thou me of rich <i>Getulia</i>?
Am not I Queene of <i>Libia</i>? then depart.</p>

<p id="id00190"><i>Iar.</i> I goe to feed the humour of my Loue,
Yet not from <i>Carthage</i> for a thousand worlds.</p>

<p id="id00191"><i>Dido.</i> <i>Iarbus</i>.</p>

<p id="id00192"><i>Iar.</i> Doth <i>Dido</i> call me backe?</p>

<p id="id00193"><i>Dido.</i> No, but I charge thee neuer looke on me.</p>

<p id="id00194"><i>Iar.</i> Then pull out both mine eyes, or let me dye. <i>Exit Iarb.</i></p>

<p id="id00195"><i>Anna.</i> Wherefore doth <i>Dido</i> bid <i>Iarbus</i> goe?</p>

<p id="id00196"><i>Dido.</i> Because his lothsome sight offends mine eye,<br/>

And in my thoughts is shrin'd another loue:<br/>

O <i>Anna</i>, didst thou know how sweet loue were,<br/>

Full soone wouldst thou abiure this single life.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00197"><i>Anna.</i> Poore soule I know too well the sower of loue,
O that <i>Iarbus</i> could but fancie me.</p>

<p id="id00198"><i>Dido.</i> Is not <i>Æneas</i> faire and beautifull?</p>

<p id="id00199"><i>Anna.</i> Yes, and <i>Iarbus</i> foule and fauourles.</p>

<p id="id00200"><i>Dido.</i> Is he not eloquent in all his speech?</p>

<p id="id00201"><i>Anna.</i> Yes, and <i>Iarbus</i> rude and rusticall.</p>

<p id="id00202"><i>Dido.</i> Name not <i>Iarbus</i>, but sweete <i>Anna</i> say,
Is not <i>Æneas</i> worthie <i>Didos</i> loue?</p>

<p id="id00203"><i>Anna.</i> O sister, were you Empresse of the world,
<i>Æneas</i> well deserues to be your loue,
So lovely is he that where ere he goes,
The people swarme to gaze him in the face.</p>

<p id="id00204"><i>Dido.</i> But tell them none shall gaze on him but I,
Lest their grosse eye-beames taint my louers cheekes:
<i>Anna</i>, good sister <i>Anna</i> goe for him,
Lest with these sweete thoughts I melt cleane away.</p>

<p id="id00205"><i>Anna.</i> Then sister youle abiure <i>Iarbus</i> loue?</p>

<p id="id00206"><i>Dido.</i> Yet must I heare that lothsome name againe?
Runne for <i>Æneas</i>, or Ile flye to him. <i>Exit Anna.</i></p>

<p id="id00207"><i>Cupid.</i> You shall not hurt my father when he comes.</p>

<p id="id00208"><i>Dido.</i> No, for thy sake Ile loue thy father well.<br/>

O dull conceipted <i>Dido</i>, that till now<br/>

Didst neuer thinke <i>Æneas</i> beautifull:<br/>

But now for quittance of this ouersight,<br/>

Ile make me bracelets of his golden haire,<br/>

His glistering eyes shall be my looking glasse,<br/>

His lips an altar, where Ile offer vp<br/>

As many kisses as the Sea hath sands,<br/>

In stead of musicke I will heare him speake,<br/>

His lookes shall be my only Librarie,<br/>

And thou <i>Æneas, Didos</i> treasurie,<br/>

In whose faire bosome I will locke more wealth,<br/>

Then twentie thousand Indiaes can affoord:<br/>

O here he comes, loue, loue, giue <i>Dido</i> leaue<br/>

To be more modest then her thoughts admit,<br/>

Lest I be made a wonder to the world.<br/>

<i>Achates</i>, how doth <i>Carthage</i> please your Lord?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00209"><i>Acha.</i> That will <i>Æneas</i> shewe your maiestie.</p>

<p id="id00210"><i>Dido.</i> <i>Æneas</i> art thou there?</p>

<p id="id00211"><i>Æn.</i> I vnderstand your highnesse sent for me.</p>

<p id="id00212"><i>Dido.</i> No, but now thou art here, tell me in sooth,
In what might <i>Dido</i> highly pleasure thee.</p>

<p id="id00213"><i>Æn.</i> So much haue I receiu'd at <i>Didos</i> hands,<br/>

As without blushing I can aske no more:<br/>

Yet Queene of <i>Affricke</i>, are my ships vnrigd,<br/>

My Sailes all rent in sunder with the winde,<br/>

My Oares broken, and my Tackling lost,<br/>

Yea all my Nauie split with Rockes and Shelfes:<br/>

Nor Sterne nor Anchor haue our maimed Fleete,<br/>

Our Masts the furious windes strooke ouer bourd:<br/>

Which piteous wants if <i>Dido</i> will supplie,<br/>

We will account her author of our liues.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00214"><i>Dido.</i>  <i>Æneas</i>, Ile repaire thy Troian ships,<br/>

Conditionally that thou wilt stay with me,<br/>

And let <i>Achates</i> saile to <i>Italy</i>:<br/>

Ile giue thee tackling made of riueld gold,<br/>

Wound on the barkes of odoriferous trees,<br/>

Oares of massie Iuorie full of holes,<br/>

Through which the water shall delight to play:<br/>

Thy Anchors shall be hewed from Christall Rockes,<br/>

Which if thou lose shall shine aboue the waues;<br/>

The Masts whereon thy swelling sailes shall hang,<br/>

Hollow Pyramides of siluer plate:<br/>

The sailes of foulded Lawne, where shall be wrought<br/>

The warres of <i>Troy</i>, but not <i>Troyes</i> ouerthrow:<br/>

For ballace, emptie <i>Didos</i> treasurie,<br/>

Take what ye will, but leaue <i>Æneas</i> here.<br/>

<i>Achates</i>, thou shalt be so meanly clad,<br/>

As Seaborne Nymphes shall swarme about thy ships,<br/>

And wanton Mermaides court thee with sweete songs,<br/>

Flinging in fauours of more soueraigne worth,<br/>

Then <i>Thetis</i> hangs about <i>Apolloes</i> necke,<br/>

So that <i>Æneas</i> may but stay with me.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00215"><i>Æn.</i> Wherefore would <i>Dido</i> haue <i>Æneas</i> stay?</p>

<p id="id00216"><i>Dido.</i> To warre against my bordering enemies:
<i>Æneas</i>, thinke not <i>Dido</i> is in loue:
For if that any man could conquer me,
I had been wedded ere <i>Æneas</i> came:
See where the pictures of my suiters hang,
And are not these as faire as faire may be?</p>

<p id="id00217"><i>Acha.</i> I saw this man at <i>Troy</i> ere <i>Troy</i> was sackt.</p>

<p id="id00218"><i>Æn.</i> I this in <i>Greece</i> when <i>Paris</i> stole faire <i>Helen</i>.</p>

<p id="id00219"><i>Illio.</i> This man and I were at <i>Olympus</i> games.</p>

<p id="id00220"><i>Serg.</i> I know this face, he is a Persian borne,
I traueld with him to <i>Ætolia</i>.</p>

<p id="id00221"><i>Cloan.</i> And I in <i>Athens</i> with this gentleman,
Vnlesse I be deceiu'd disputed once.</p>

<p id="id00222"><i>Dido.</i> But speake <i>Æneas</i>, know you none of these?</p>

<p id="id00223"><i>Æn.</i> No Madame, but it seemes that these are Kings.</p>

<p id="id00224"><i>Dido.</i> All these and others which I neuer sawe,<br/>

Haue been most vrgent suiters for my loue,<br/>

Some came in person, others sent their Legats:<br/>

Yet none obtaind me, I am free from all,<br/>

And yet God knowes intangled vnto one.<br/>

This was an Orator, and thought by words<br/>

To compasse me, but yet he was deceiu'd:<br/>

And this a Spartan Courtier vaine and wilde,<br/>

But his fantastick humours pleasde not me:<br/>

This was <i>Alcion</i>, a Musition,<br/>

But playd he nere so sweet, I let him goe:<br/>

This was the wealthie King of <i>Thessaly</i>,<br/>

But I had gold enough and cast him off:<br/>

This <i>Meleagers</i> sonne, a warlike Prince,<br/>

But weapons gree not with my tender yeares:<br/>

The rest are such as all the world well knowes,<br/>

Yet how I sweare by heauen and him I loue,<br/>

I was as farre from loue, as they from hate.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00225"><i>Æn.</i> O happie shall he be whom <i>Dido</i> loues.</p>

<p id="id00226"><i>Dido.</i> Then neuer say that thou art miserable,<br/>

Because it may be thou shalt be my loue:<br/>

Yet boast not of it, for I loue thee not,<br/>

And yet I hate thee not: O if I speake<br/>

I shall betray my selfe: <i>Æneas</i> speake,<br/>

We two will goe a hunting in the woods,<br/>

But not so much for thee, thou art but one,<br/>

As for <i>Achates</i>, and his followers.   <i>Exeunt.</i><br/>
</p>

<p id="id00227"><i>Enter Iuno to Ascanius asleepe.</i></p>

<p id="id00228"><i>Iuno.</i> Here lyes my hate, <i>Æneas</i> cursed brat,<br/>

The boy wherein false destinie delights,<br/>

The heire of furie, the fauorite of the face,<br/>

That vgly impe that shall outweare my wrath,<br/>

And wrong my deitie with high disgrace:<br/>

But I will take another order now,<br/>

And race th'eternall Register of time:<br/>

<i>Troy</i> shall no more call him her second hope,<br/>

Nor <i>Venus</i> triumph in his tender youth:<br/>

For here in spight of heauen Ile murder him,<br/>

And feede infection with his left out life:<br/>

Say <i>Paris</i>, now shall <i>Venus</i> haue the ball?<br/>

Say vengeance, now shall her <i>Ascanius</i> dye.<br/>

O no God wot, I cannot watch my time,<br/>

Nor quit good turnes with double fee downe told:<br/>

Tut, I am simple without made to hurt,<br/>

And haue no gall at all to grieue my foes:<br/>

But lustfull <i>Ioue</i> and his adulterous child,<br/>

Shall finde it written on confusions front,<br/>

That onely <i>Iuno</i> rules in <i>Rhamnuse</i> towne.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00229"><i>Enter Venus.</i></p>

<p id="id00230"><i>Venus.</i> What should this meane? my Doues are back returnd,
Who warne me of such daunger prest at hand,
To harme my sweete <i>Ascanius</i> louely life.
<i>Iuno</i>, my mortall foe, what make you here?
Auaunt old witch and trouble not my wits.</p>

<p id="id00231"><i>Iuno.</i> Fie <i>Venus</i>, that such causeles words of wrath,<br/>

Should ere defile so faire a mouth as thine:<br/>

Are not we both sprong of celestiall rase,<br/>

And banquet as two Sisters with the Gods?<br/>

Why is it then displeasure should disioyne,<br/>

Whom kindred and acquaintance counites.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00232"><i>Venus.</i> Out hatefull hag, thou wouldst haue slaine my sonne,<br/>

Had not my Doues discou'rd thy entent:<br/>

But I will teare thy eyes fro forth thy head,<br/>

And feast the birds with their bloud-shotten balles,<br/>

If thou but lay thy fingers on my boy.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00233"><i>Iuno.</i> Is this then all the thankes that I shall haue,<br/>

For sauing him from Snakes and Serpents stings,<br/>

That would haue kild him sleeping as he lay?<br/>

What though I was offended with thy sonne,<br/>

And wrought him mickle woe on sea and land,<br/>

When for the hate of Troian <i>Ganimed</i>,<br/>

That was aduanced by my <i>Hebes</i> shame,<br/>

And <i>Paris</i> iudgement of the heauenly ball,<br/>

I mustred all the windes vnto his wracke,<br/>

And vrg'd each Element to his annoy:<br/>

Yet now I doe repent me of his ruth,<br/>

And wish that I had neuer wrongd him so:<br/>

Bootles I sawe it was to warre with fate,<br/>

That hath so many vnresisted friends:<br/>

Wherefore I chaunge my counsell with the time,<br/>

And planted loue where enuie erst had sprong.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00234"><i>Venus.</i> Sister of <i>Ioue</i>, if that thy loue be such,<br/>

As these thy protestations doe paint forth,<br/>

We two as friends one fortune will deuide:<br/>

<i>Cupid</i> shall lay his arrowes in thy lap,<br/>

And to a Scepter chaunge his golden shafts,<br/>

Fancie and modestie shall liue as mates,<br/>

And thy faire peacockes by my pigeons pearch:<br/>

Loue my <i>Æneas</i>, and desire is thine,<br/>

The day, the night, my Swannes, my sweetes are thine.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00235"><i>Iuno.</i> More then melodious are these words to me,<br/>

That ouercioy my soule with their content:<br/>

<i>Venus</i>, sweete <i>Venus</i>, how may I deserue<br/>

Such amourous fauours at thy beautious hand?<br/>

But that thou maist more easilie perceiue,<br/>

How highly I doe prize this amitie,<br/>

Harke to a motion of eternall league,<br/>

Which I will make in quittance of thy loue:<br/>

Thy sonne thou knowest with <i>Dido</i> now remaines,<br/>

And feedes his eyes with fauours of her Court,<br/>

She likewise in admyring spends her time,<br/>

And cannot talke nor thinke of ought but him:<br/>

Why should not they then ioyne in marriage,<br/>

And bring forth mightie Kings to Carthage towne,<br/>

Whom casualtie of sea hath made such friends?<br/>

And <i>Venus</i>, let there be a match confirmd<br/>

Betwixt these two, whose loues are so alike,<br/>

And both our Deities conioynd in one,<br/>

Shall chaine felicitie vnto their throne.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00236"><i>Venus.</i> Well could I like this reconcilements meanes,<br/>

But much I feare my sonne will nere consent,<br/>

Whose armed soule alreadie on the sea,<br/>

Darts forth her light to <i>Lauinias</i> shoare.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00237"><i>Iuno.</i> Faire Queene of loue, I will deuorce these doubts,<br/>

And finde the way to wearie such fond thoughts:<br/>

This day they both a hunting forth will ride<br/>

Into these woods, adioyning to these walles,<br/>

When in the midst of all their gamesome sports,<br/>

Ile make the Clowdes dissolue their watrie workes,<br/>

And drench <i>Siluanus</i> dwellings with their shewers,<br/>

Then in one Caue the Queene and he shall meete,<br/>

And interchangeably discourse their thoughts,<br/>

Whose short conclusion will seale vp their hearts,<br/>

Vnto the purpose which we now propound.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00238"><i>Venus.</i> Sister, I see you sauour of my wiles,<br/>

Be it as you will haue for this once,<br/>

Meane time, <i>Ascanius</i> shall be my charge,<br/>

Whom I will beare to <i>Ida</i> in mine armes,<br/>

And couch him in <i>Adonis</i> purple downe, <i>Exeunt.</i><br/>
</p>

<p id="id00239"><i>Enter Dido, Æneas, Anna, Iarbus, Achates, and followers.</i></p>

<p id="id00240"><i>Dido.</i> <i>Æneas</i>, thinke not but I honor thee,<br/>

That thus in person goe with thee to hunt:<br/>

My princely robes thou seest are layd aside,<br/>

Whose glittering pompe <i>Dianas</i> shrowdes supplies,<br/>

All fellowes now disposde alike to sporte,<br/>

The woods are wide, and we haue store of game:<br/>

Faire Troian, hold my golden bowe awhile,<br/>

Vntill I gird my quiuer to my side:<br/>

Lords goe before, we two must talke alone.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00241"><i>Iar.</i> Vngentle, can she wrong <i>Iarbus</i> so?
Ile dye before a stranger haue that grace:
We two will talke alone, what words be these?</p>

<p id="id00242"><i>Dido.</i> What makes <i>Iarbus</i> here of all the rest?
We could haue gone without your companie.</p>

<p id="id00243"><i>Æn.</i> But loue and duetie led him on perhaps,
To presse beyond acceptance to your sight.</p>

<p id="id00244"><i>Iar.</i> Why man of <i>Troy</i>, doe I offend thine eyes?
Or art thou grieude thy betters presse so nye?</p>

<p id="id00245"><i>Dido.</i> How now Getulian, are ye growne so braue,
To challenge vs with your comparisons?
Pesant, goe seeke companions like thy selfe,
And meddle not with any that I loue:
<i>Æneas</i>, be not moude at what he sayes,
For otherwhile he will be out of ioynt.</p>

<p id="id00246"><i>Iar.</i> Women may wrong by priuiledge of loue:<br/>

But should that man of men (<i>Dido</i> except)<br/>

Haue taunted me in these opprobrious termes,<br/>

I would haue either drunke his dying bloud,<br/>

Or els I would haue giuen my life in gage?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00247"><i>Dido.</i> Huntsmen, why pitch you not your toyles apace,
And rowse the light foote Deere from forth their laire.</p>

<p id="id00248"><i>Anna.</i> Sister, see see <i>Ascanius</i> in his pompe,
Bearing his huntspeare brauely in his hand.</p>

<p id="id00249"><i>Dido.</i> Yea little sonne, are you so forward now?</p>

<p id="id00250"><i>Asca.</i> I mother, I shall one day be a man,<br/>

And better able vnto other armes,<br/>

Meane time these wanton weapons serue my warre,<br/>

Which I will breake betwixt a Lyons iawes.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00251"><i>Dido.</i> What, darest thou looke a Lyon in the face?</p>

<p id="id00252"><i>Asca.</i> I, and outface him to, doe what he can.</p>

<p id="id00253"><i>Anna.</i> How like his father speaketh he in all?</p>

<p id="id00254"><i>Æn.</i> And mought I liue to see him sacke rich <i>Thebes</i>,<br/>

And loade his speare with Grecian Princes heads,<br/>

Then would I wish me with <i>Anchises</i> Tombe,<br/>

And dead to honour that hath brought me vp.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00255"><i>Iar.</i> And might I liue to see thee shipt away,<br/>

And hoyst aloft on <i>Neptunes</i> hideous hilles,<br/>

Then would I wish me in faire <i>Didos</i> armes,<br/>

</p>

<p id="id00256"><i>Æn.</i> Stoute friend <i>Achates</i>, doest thou know this wood?</p>

<p id="id00257"><i>Acha.</i> As I remember, here you shot the Deere,<br/>

That sau'd your famisht souldiers liues from death,<br/>

When first you set your foote vpon the shoare,<br/>

Bearing her bowe and quiuer at her backe.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00258"><i>Æn.</i> O how these irksome labours now delight,<br/>

</p>

<p id="id00259"><i>Dido.</i> <i>Æneas</i>, leaue these dumpes and lets away,

<p id="id00261"><i>Iar.</i> I, this it is which wounds me to the death,<br/>

O loue, O hate, O cruell womens hearts,<br/>

That imitate the Moone in euery chaunge,<br/>

And like the Planets euer loue to raunge:<br/>

What shall I doe thus wronged with disdaine?<br/>

Reuenge me on <i>Æneas</i>, or on her:<br/>

On her? fond man, that were to warre gainst heauen,<br/>

And with one shaft prouoke ten thousand darts:<br/>

This Troians end will be thy enuies aime,<br/>

Whose bloud will reconcile thee to content,<br/>

And make loue drunken with thy sweete desire:<br/>

But <i>Dido</i> that now holdeth him so deare,<br/>

Will dye with very tidings of his death:<br/>

But time will discontinue her content,<br/>

And mould her minde vnto newe fancies shapes:<br/>

O God of heauen, turne the hand of fate<br/>

Vnto that happie day of my delight,<br/>

And then, what then? <i>Iarbus</i> shall but loue:<br/>

So doth he now, though not with equall gaine,<br/>

And I must perish in his burning armes:

Better he frowne, then I should dye for griefe:<br/>

I cannot see him frowne, it may not be:<br/>

Armies of foes resolu'd to winne this towne,<br/>

Or impious traitors vowde to haue my life,<br/>

Thou wouldst haue leapt from out the Sailers hands,<br/>

And yet I blame thee not, thou art but wood.<br/>

The water which our Poets terme a Nimph,<br/>

Why did it suffer thee to touch her breast,<br/>

The water is an Element, no Nimph,<br/>

Why should I blame <i>Æneas</i> for his flight?<br/>

O <i>Dido</i>, blame not him, but breake his oares,<br/>

These were the instruments that launcht him forth,<br/>

Theres not so much as this base tackling too,<br/>

But dares to heape vp sorrowe to my heart:<br/>

Was it not you that hoysed vp these sailes?<br/>

Why burst you not, and they fell in the seas?<br/>

For this will <i>Dido</i> tye ye full of knots,<br/>

And sheere ye all asunder with her hands:<br/>

Now serue to chastize shipboyes for their faults,<br/>

Ye shall no more offend the Carthage Queene,<br/>

Now let him hang my fauours on his masts,<br/>

And see if those will serue in steed of sailes:<br/>

For tackling, let him take the chaines of gold,<br/>

Which I bestowd vpon his followers:<br/>

In steed of oares, let him vse his hands,<br/>

And swim to <i>Italy</i>, Ile keepe these sure:<br/>

And thou despise the praise of such attempts:<br/>

Yet thinke vpon <i>Ascanius</i> prophesie,<br/>

And yong <i>Iulus</i> more then thousand yeares,<br/>

Whom I haue brought from <i>Ida</i> where he slept,<br/>

And bore yong <i>Cupid</i> vnto <i>Cypresse</i> Ile.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00382"><i>Æn.</i> This was my mother that beguild the Queene,<br/>

And made me take my brother for my sonne:<br/>

No maruell <i>Dido</i> though thou be in loue,<br/>

That daylie danlest <i>Cupid</i> in thy armes:<br/>

Welcome sweet child, where hast thou been this long?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00383"><i>Asca.</i> Eating sweet Comfites with Queene <i>Didos</i> maide,
Who euer since hath luld me in her armes.</p>

<p id="id00384"><i>Æn.</i> <i>Sergestus</i>, beare him hence vnto our ships,
Lest <i>Dido</i> spying him keepe him for a pledge.</p>

<p id="id00385"><i>Hermes.</i> Spendst thou thy time about this little boy,<br/>

And giuest not care vnto the charge I bring?<br/>

I tell thee thou must straight to <i>Italy</i>,<br/>

Or els abide the wrath of frowning <i>Ioue</i>.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00386"><i>Æn.</i> How should I put into the raging deepe,<br/>

Who haue no sailes nor tackling for my ships?<br/>

What would the Gods haue me <i>Deucalion</i> like,<br/>

Flote vp and downe where ere the billowes driue?<br/>

Though she repairde my fleete and gaue me ships,<br/>

Yet hath she tane away my oares and masts,<br/>

And left me neither saile nor sterne abourd.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00387"><i>Enter to them Iarbus.</i></p>

<p id="id00388"><i>Iar.</i> How now <i>Æneas</i>, sad, what meanes these dumpes?</p>

<p id="id00389"><i>Æn.</i> <i>Iarbus</i>, I am cleane besides my selfe,
<i>Ioue</i> hath heapt on me such a desperate charge,
Which neither art nor reason may atchieue,
Nor I deuise by what meanes to contriue.</p>

<p id="id00390"><i>Iar.</i> As how I pray, may I entreat you tell.</p>

<p id="id00391"><i>Æn.</i> With speede he bids me sail to <i>Italy</i>.
When as I want both rigging for my fleete,
And also furniture for these my men.</p>

<p id="id00392"><i>Iar.</i> If that be all, then cheare thy drooping lookes,<br/>

For I will furnish thee with such supplies:<br/>

Let some of those thy followers goe with me,<br/>

And they shall haue what thing so ere thou needst.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00393"><i>Æn.</i> Thankes good <i>Iarbus</i> for thy friendly ayde,
<i>Achates</i> and the rest shall waite on thee,
Whil'st I rest thankfull for this curtesie.</p>

<p id="id00394"><i>Exit Iarbus and Æneas traine.</i></p>

<p id="id00395">Now will I haste vnto <i>Lauinian</i> shoare,<br/>

And raise a new foundation to old <i>Troy</i>,<br/>

Witnes the Gods, and witnes heauen and earth,<br/>

How loth I am to leaue these <i>Libian</i> bounds,<br/>

But that eternall <i>Iupiter</i> commands.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00396"><i>Enter Dido and Æneas.</i></p>

<p id="id00397"><i>Dido.</i> I feare I sawe <i>Æneas</i> little sonne,<br/>

Led by <i>Achates</i> to the Troian fleete:<br/>

If it be so, his father meanes to flye:<br/>

But here he is, now <i>Dido</i> trie thy wit.<br/>

<i>Æneas</i>, wherefore goe thy men abourd?,<br/>

Why are thy ships new rigd? or to what end<br/>

Launcht from the hauen, lye they in the Rhode?<br/>

Pardon me though I aske, loue makes me aske.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00398"><i>Æn.</i> O pardon me, if I resolue thee why:
<i>Æneas</i> will not faine with his deare loue,
I must from hence: this day swift <i>Mercury</i>
When I was laying a platforme for these walles,
Sent from his father <i>Ioue</i>, appeard to me,
And in his name rebukt me bitterly,
For lingering here, neglecting <i>Italy</i>.</p>

<p id="id00399"><i>Dido.</i> But yet <i>Æneas</i> will not leaue his loue.</p>

<p id="id00400"><i>Æn.</i> I am commaunded by immortal <i>Ioue</i>,
To leaue this towne and passe to <i>Italy</i>,
And therefore must of force.</p>

<p id="id00401"><i>Dido.</i> These words proceed not from <i>Æneas</i> heart.</p>

<p id="id00402"><i>Æn.</i> Not from my heart, for I can hardly goe,
And yet I may not stay, <i>Dido</i> farewell.</p>

<p id="id00403"><i>Dido.</i> Farewell: is this the mends for <i>Didos</i> loue?<br/>

Doe Troians vse to quit their Louers thus?<br/>

Fare well may <i>Dido</i>, so <i>Æneas</i> stay,<br/>

I dye, if my <i>Æneas</i> say farewell.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00404"><i>Æn.</i> Then let me goe and neuer say farewell,
Let me goe, farewell, I must from hence.</p>

<p id="id00405"><i>Dido.</i> These words are poyson to poore <i>Didos</i> soule,<br/>

O speake like my <i>Æneas</i>, like my loue:<br/>

Why look'st thou toward the sea? the time hath been<br/>

When <i>Didos</i> beautie chaungd thine eyes to her;<br/>

Am I lesse faire then when thou sawest me first?<br/>

O then <i>Æneas</i>, tis for griefe of thee:<br/>

Say thou wilt stay in <i>Carthage</i> with my Queene,<br/>

And <i>Didos</i> beautie will returne againe:<br/>

<i>Æneas</i>, say, how canst thou take thy leaue?<br/>

Wilt thou kisse <i>Dido</i>? O thy lips haue sworne<br/>

To stay with <i>Dido</i>: canst thou take her hand?<br/>

Thy Hand and mine haue plighted mutuall faith,<br/>

Therefore vnkinde <i>Æneas</i>, must thou say,<br/>

Then let me goe, and neuer say farewell.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00406"><i>Æn.</i> O Queene of <i>Carthage</i>, wert thou vgly blacke,
<i>Æneas</i> could not choose but hold thee deare,
Yet must he not gainsay the Gods behest.</p>

<p id="id00407"><i>Dido.</i> The Gods, what Gods be those that seeke my death?<br/>

Wherein haue I offended <i>Iupiter</i>,<br/>

That he should take <i>Æneas</i> from mine armes?<br/>

O no, the Gods wey not what Louers doe,<br/>

It is <i>Æneas</i> calles <i>Æneas</i> hence,<br/>

And wofull <i>Dido</i> by these blubbred cheekes,<br/>

By this right hand, and by our spousall rites,<br/>

Desires <i>Æneas</i> to remaine with her:<br/>

<i>Si bene quid de te merui, fuit aut tibi quidquam<br/>

Dulce meum, miserere domus labentis: &amp; istam<br/>

Oro, si quis ad hac precibus locus, exue mentem.</i><br/>
</p>

<p id="id00408"><i>Æn. Desine meque tuis incendere teque querelis,
Italiam non sponte sequor.</i></p>

<p id="id00409"><i>Dido.</i> Hast thou forgot how many neighbour kings<br/>

Were vp in armes, for making thee my loue?<br/>

How <i>Carthage</i> did rebell, <i>Iarbus</i> storme,<br/>

And all the world calles me a second <i>Helen</i>,<br/>

For being intangled by a strangers lookes:<br/>

So thou wouldst proue as true as <i>Paris</i> did,<br/>

Would, as faire <i>Troy</i> was, <i>Carthage</i> might be sackt,<br/>

And I be calde a second <i>Helena</i>.<br/>

Had I a sonne by thee, the griefe were lesse,<br/>

That I might see <i>Æneas</i> in his face:<br/>

Now if thou goest, what canst thou leaue behind,<br/>

But rather will augment then ease my woe?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00410"><i>Æn.</i> In vaine my loue thou spendst thy fainting breath,
If words might moue me I were ouercome.</p>

<p id="id00411"><i>Dido.</i> And wilt thou not be mou'd with <i>Didos</i> words?<br/>

Thy mother was no Goddesse periurd man,<br/>

Nor <i>Dardanus</i> the author of thy stocke:<br/>

But thou art Sprung from <i>Scythian Caucasus</i>,<br/>

And Tygers of <i>Hircania</i> gaue thee sucke:<br/>

Ah foolish <i>Dido</i> to forbeare this long!<br/>

Wast thou not wrackt vpon this <i>Libian</i> shoare,<br/>

And cam'st to <i>Dido</i> like a Fisherswaine?<br/>

Repairde not I thy ships, made thee a King,<br/>

And all thy needie followers Noblemen?<br/>

O Serpent that came creeping from the shoare,<br/>

And I for pitie harbord in my bosome,<br/>

Wilt thou now slay me with thy venomed sting,<br/>

And hisse at <i>Dido</i> for preseruing thee?<br/>

Goe goe and spare not, seeke out <i>Italy</i>,<br/>

I hope that that which loue forbids me doe,<br/>

The Rockes and Sea-gulfes will performe at large,<br/>

And thou shalt perish in the billowes waies,<br/>

To whom poore <i>Dido</i> doth bequeath reuenge,<br/>

I traytor, and the waues shall cast thee vp,<br/>

Where thou and false <i>Achates</i> first set foote:<br/>

Which if it chaunce, Ile giue ye buriall,<br/>

And weepe vpon your liueles carcases,<br/>

Though thou nor he will pitie me a whit.<br/>

Why star'st thou in my face? if thou wilt stay,<br/>

Leape in mine armes, mine armes are open wide:<br/>

If not, turne from me, and Ile turne from thee;<br/>

For though thou hast the heart to say farewell,<br/>

I haue not power to stay thee: is he gone?<br/>

I but heele come againe, he cannot goe,<br/>

He loues me to too well to serue me so:<br/>

Yet he that in my sight would not relent,<br/>

Will, being absent, be abdurate still.<br/>

By this is he got to the water side,<br/>

And, see the Sailers take him by the hand,<br/>

But he shrinkes backe, and now remembring me,<br/>

Returnes amaine: welcome, welcome my loue:<br/>

But wheres <i>Æneas</i>? ah hees gone hees gone!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00412"><i>Anna.</i> What meanes my sister thus to raue and crye?</p>

<p id="id00413"><i>Dido.</i> O <i>Anna</i>, my <i>Æneas</i> is abourd,<br/>

And leauing me will saile to <i>Italy</i>.<br/>

Once didst thou goe, and he came backe againe,<br/>

Now bring him backe, and thou shalt be a Queene,<br/>

And I will liue a priuate life with him.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00414"><i>Anna.</i> Wicked <i>Æneas</i>.</p>

<p id="id00415"><i>Dido.</i> Call him not wicked, sister speake him faire,<br/>

And looke vpon him with a Mermaides eye,<br/>

Tell him, I neuer vow'd at <i>Aulis</i> gulfe<br/>

The desolation of his natiue <i>Troy</i>,<br/>

Nor sent a thousand ships vnto the walles,<br/>

Nor euer violated faith to him:<br/>

Request him gently (<i>Anna</i>) to returne,<br/>

I craue but this, he stay a tide or two,<br/>

That I may learne to beare it patiently,<br/>

If he depart thus suddenly, I dye:<br/>

Run <i>Anna</i>, run, stay not to answere me.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00416"><i>Anna.</i> I goe faire sister, heauens graunt good successe.</p>

<p id="id00417"><i>Exit Anna.</i></p>

<p id="id00418"><i>Enter the Nurse.</i></p>

<p id="id00419"><i>Nurse.</i> O <i>Dido</i>, your little sonne <i>Ascanius</i><br/>

Is gone! he lay with me last night,<br/>

And in the morning he was stolne from me,<br/>

I thinke some Fairies haue beguiled me.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00420"><i>Dido.</i> O cursed hagge and false dissembling wretch!<br/>

That slayest me with thy harsh and hellish tale,<br/>

Thou for some pettie guift hast let him goe,<br/>

And I am thus deluded of my boy:<br/>

Away with her to prison presently,<br/>

Traytoresse too keend and cursed Sorceresse.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00421"><i>Nurse.</i> I know not what you meane by treason, I,
I am as true as any one of yours. <i>Exeunt the Nurse.</i></p>

<p id="id00422"><i>Dido.</i> Away with her, suffer her not to speake.
My sister comes, I like not her sad lookes.</p>

<p id="id00423"><i>Enter Anna.</i></p>

<p id="id00424"><i>Anna.</i> Before I came, <i>Æneas</i> was abourd,<br/>

And spying me, hoyst vp the sailes amaine:<br/>

But I cride out, <i>Æneas</i>, false <i>Æneas</i> stay.<br/>

Then gan he wagge his hand, which yet held vp,<br/>

Made me suppose he would haue heard me speake:<br/>

Then gan they driue into the Ocean,<br/>

Which when I viewd, I cride, <i>Æneas</i> stay,<br/>

<i>Dido</i>, faire <i>Dido</i> wils <i>Æneas</i> stay:<br/>

Yet he whose heart of adamant or flint,<br/>

My teares nor plaints could mollifie a whit:<br/>

Then carelesly I rent my haire for griefe,<br/>

Which seene to all, though he beheld me not,<br/>

They gan to moue him to redresse my ruth,<br/>

And stay a while to heare what I could say,<br/>

But he clapt vnder hatches saild away.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00425"><i>Dido.</i> O <i>Anna</i>, <i>Anna</i>, I will follow him.</p>

<p id="id00426"><i>Anna.</i> How can ye goe when he hath all your fleete?</p>

<p id="id00427"><i>Dido.</i> Ile frame me wings of waxe like <i>Icarus</i>,<br/>

And ore his ships will soare vnto the Sunne,<br/>

That they may melt and I fall in his armes:<br/>

Or els Ile make a prayer vnto the waues,<br/>

That I may swim to him like <i>Tritons</i> neece:<br/>

O <i>Anna</i>, fetch <i>Orions</i> Harpe,<br/>

That I may tice a Dolphin to the shoare,<br/>

And ride vpon his backe vnto my loue:<br/>

Looke sister, looke louely <i>Æneas</i> ships,<br/>

See see, the billowes heaue him vp to heauen,<br/>

And now downe falles the keeles into the deepe:<br/>

O sister, sister, take away the Rockes,<br/>

Theile breake his ships, O <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Neptune</i>, <i>Ioue</i>,<br/>

Saue, saue <i>Æneas</i>, <i>Didos</i> leefest loue!<br/>

Now is he come on shoare safe without hurt:<br/>

But see, <i>Achates</i> wils him put to sea,<br/>

And all the Sailers merrie make for ioy,<br/>

But he remembring me shrinkes backe againe:<br/>

See where he comes, welcome, welcome my loue.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00428"><i>Anna.</i> Ah sister, leaue these idle fantasies,
Sweet sister cease, remember who you are.</p>

<p id="id00429"><i>Dido. Dido</i> I am, vnlesse I be deceiu'd,<br/>

And must I raue thus for a renegate?<br/>

Must I make ships for him to saile away?<br/>

Nothing can beare me to him but a ship,<br/>

And he hath all thy fleete, what shall I doe?<br/>

But dye in furie of this ouersight?<br/>

I, I must be the murderer of my selfe:<br/>

No but I am not, yet I will be straight.<br/>

<i>Anna</i> be glad, now haue I found a meane<br/>

To rid me from these thoughts of Lunacie:<br/>

Not farre from hence there is a woman famoused for arts,<br/>

Daughter vnto the Nimphs <i>Hesperides</i>,<br/>

Who wild me sacrifice his ticing relliques:<br/>

Goe <i>Anna</i>, bid my seruants bring me fire.  <i>Exit Anna.</i><br/>
</p>

<p id="id00430"><i>Enter Iarbus.</i></p>

<p id="id00431"><i>Iar.</i> How long will <i>Dido</i> mourne a strangers flight,<br/>

That hath dishonord her and <i>Carthage</i> both?<br/>

How long shall I with griefe consume my daies,<br/>

And reape no guerdon for my truest loue?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00432"><i>Dido.</i> <i>Iarbus</i>, talk not of <i>Æneas</i>, let him goe,<br/>

Lay to thy hands and helpe me make a fire,<br/>

That shall consume all that this stranger left,<br/>

For I entend a priuate Sacrifize,<br/>

To cure my minde that melts for vnkind loue.<br/>

<p id="id00433"><i>Iar.</i> But afterwards will <i>Dido</i> graunt me loue?</p>

<p id="id00434"><i>Dido.</i> I, I, <i>Iarbus</i>, after this is done,<br/>

None in the world shall have my loue but thou:<br/>

So, leaue me now, let none approach this place. <i>Exit Iarbus.</i><br/>

Now <i>Dido</i>, with these reliques burne thy selfe,<br/>

And make <i>Æneas</i> famous through the world,<br/>

For periurie and slaughter of a Queene:<br/>

Here lye the Sword that in the darksome Caue<br/>

He drew, and swore by to be true to me,<br/>

Thou shalt burne first, thy crime is worse then his:<br/>

Here lye the garment which I cloath'd him in,<br/>

When first he came on shoare, perish thou to:<br/>

These letters, lines, and periurd papers all,<br/>

Shall burne to cinders in this prectious flame.<br/>

And now ye Gods that guide the starrie frame,<br/>

And order all things at your high dispose;<br/>

Graunt, though the traytors land in <i>Italy</i>,<br/>

They may be still tormented with vnrest,<br/>

And from mine ashes let a Conquerour rise,<br/>

That may reuenge this treason to a Queene,<br/>

By plowing vp his Countries with the Sword:<br/>

Betwixt this land and that be neuer league,<br/>

What fatall destinie enuies me thus,<br/>

To see my sweet <i>Iarbus</i> slay himselfe?<br/>

But <i>Anna</i> now shall honor thee in death,<br/>

And mixe her bloud with thine, this shall I doe,<br/>

<p id="id00471">1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<h4 id="id00477" style="margin-top: 2em">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>

<p id="id00478">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id00479">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h4 id="id00484" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h4>

<p id="id00485">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p id="id00486">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org</p>

<p id="id00487">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p id="id00488">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p id="id00489">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate</p>

<h4 id="id00490" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h4>

<p id="id00491">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p id="id00492" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id00493" style="margin-top: 2em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>

<p id="id00494">     http://www.gutenberg.net<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00495">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
